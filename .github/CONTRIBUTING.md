# Conduit Contributing Guide

Welcome! We are really excited that you are interested in contributing to Conduit.
Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ConduitPlatform/Conduit-Website/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Issue Reporting Guidelines](#issue-reporting-guidelines)
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

- When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. 

- Before creating issue reports, perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

- If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

- Open a new issue using the [Issue Template](https://github.com/ConduitPlatform/Conduit-Website/issues)

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Checkout a topic branch from `main`, and merge back.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub will automatically squash it before merging.

- If adding a new feature:
    - Add accompanying test case.
    - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing a bug:
    - If you are resolving a reported issue, add `(fix #xxx)` (#xxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. `update entities encoding/decoding (fix #389)`.
    - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR and the steps to reproduce it.

- **DO NOT** change `.gitignore`.

- Open a new pull request using the [Pull Request Template](https://github.com/ConduitPlatform/Conduit-Website/compare)
