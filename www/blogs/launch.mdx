  <p>
  Backend development is a tricky sport, as is everything software oriented,
  and like all software there are things that are repeatable in its process.
  This is one of the first things that any software engineer learns, abstraction and reusability of code,
  which should be always followed to create readable, maintainable, and stable codebases.
  When you are a software house though, or when you have a massive API with multiple micro-services,
  you start having to repeat the same processes again and again. There are solutions to this matter of course,
  using platforms like Kong or more infrastructure-oriented ones like Istio (or any service mesh for that matter),
  so that you can abstract things like authentication and API management.
</p>
  <p>
  All possible solutions, as every solution to any known issue ever, have their drawbacks and mostly consist of lack
  of flexibility,
  high DevOps costs and, usually, getting you, at best, 70% of the way there. When I co-founded Quintessential,
  we started noticing a repeating pattern to our work. Our backend team always had to implement an authentication
  system,
  they had to create various CRUD routes for different database models,
  implement various security checks and write different APIs sometimes RESTful sometimes GraphQL.
  Being a digital product development company though, meant that everything we do has to make sense for our client and
  be in-budget.
  Thus, implementing each single mechanic perfectly isn‚Äôt an option a lot of the time, since the client requires an
  MVP,
  and understands features delivered and not if the API has rate-limiting or is resilient to regex DDoS attacks,
  or if it can easily support new changes.
</p>
  <p>
  This weird deadlock we found ourselves into, meant that if we want to radically increase our deliverable quality and
  stay in budget,
  we needed to create a system or a platform rather, that can take care all of the typical stuff for the backend
  systems,
  while the backend developers focused on how to implement business logic and optimize processes.
</p>
  My answer to this problem is <strong>Conduit</strong>.

<br></br>
<br></br>
<SectionItemComponent topic="How it's going" />
Conduit was created with several goals in mind:

  - It should provide out-of-the-box functionality on repeatable features: Authentication, Micro-service support, API
documentation and validation, API Security etc.
  - It should be flexible, allowing developers to create services with minimal overhead to their coding process
  - It should be extendable and modular, so that we can add more features as it evolves.

Oh, and I almost forgot the most important part, it should be <strong>Open Source</strong>.
This is a big deal for me, since Quintessential
has flourished due to OSS, and the least I could do is give back to this amazing community,
that helped me and my engineering team deliver cutting-edge software.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<SectionItemComponent topic='The basics' />
So, what does it do you say? Well to begin with, Conduit consists of 2 basic elements, the core and the modules.
The core contains the client and admin routers, the configuration service, the security service and a
library to glue everything together, written in Node.JS with ExpressJS. The modules are the "Lego" bricks that make
the Conduit magic, and as of now are all made with NodeJS as well. The most important module is the Database module, which
is a requirement for the core itself to initialize, and after that you simply spin-up any module you want according to the
functionality required. We‚Äôll go through them in summary below:

- üîí Authentication
  * Contains request authorization middleware
  * Supports login/register with email/password, username/password
  * Support third-party providers like Facebook, Google, Twitch, Microsoft, Github, Figma and more coming
  * Using API keys (service accounts) (for service-to-service communications)
  * Supports 2FA through SMS
  * Supports Email verifications, password resets and password change.
- üì´ Email
  * Can send emails through Mailgun, Mandrill(mailchimp), SendGrid and regular SMTP servers
  * Provides tools for email template creation and management inside the platform
  * Synchronizes email templates in a 2-way fashion between your external provider and Conduit itself
- üìí Database
  * Connects either to MongoDB or PostgreSQL
  * Provides a simple BSON-based API
  * Handles schema management, registration etc
- üì± SMS
  * Provides an API to send SMS messages through Twilio (more providers coming soon)
  * (coming soon) manage sms templates
- ‚úçÔ∏è CMS
  * Creates and manages schemas that are registered through the admin panel
  * Creates CRUD operations for all CMS-managed schemas
  * Creates and manages custom operations on schemas with custom queries
- üí¨ Chat
  * Creates and manages chat sessions using sockets
  * Supports message reads and multi-user chats
- üßæ Forms
  * Allow for basic form submission
  * Forwards responses to specified email addresses
  * Does basic checking for spam addresses
- üì¶ Storage
  * Handles Blob storage, using Local storage (for development), Azure Storage or Google Cloud (S3 coming soon)

As you can see we‚Äôve added a fair bit of functionality already, and we continue to add more while
also optimizing the platform‚Äôs processes.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<SectionItemComponent topic='The details' />
Let‚Äôs talk a bit more about how all of this works.

The core and its modules are simple grpc micro-services. They are designed to be linearly scalable and flexible so
that they can change their configuration and functionality on the fly. The core contains all functionality that stores
module configuration, declared routes from the modules, is responsible to enforce security and constructs 4 different
routers for clients to connect to. The 2 basic ones are the REST and the GraphQL APIs, both of which have full
validations and type support, so that service developers only need to specify the correct type, and the core enforces
it. The other 2 routers are the admin router, which handles routes for module administration and the authorization
required for conduit admins and finally the socket router, which contains all the necessary functionality to expose
sockets through which modules like Chat can work.

One main differentiator of Conduit technology-wise compared to other modular/extensible platforms, is that the entirety
of its overhead for configuration is handled on startup or on configuration changes. When a request comes through, each
module already knows what it's supposed to do, without having to do greedy DB calls or calculations to figure it out.
The result of this is nearly zero overhead on requests, which in turn means that it's behaviour is similar to what you
expect for your own custom code.

Being a grpc-based platform, means that conduit has very low latency for intra-module communications. At such a point
where if you were to launch the entire platform in a single machine, the latency is comparable to simple function
calls (give or take few ms). Of course, we‚Äôre not even at the final optimization stage. Currently, most Conduit requests take less
than 100ms to complete (authentication included), and that‚Äôs by communicating with servers that are in different
countries entirely. Since we believe that conduit is currently adding a 10-15ms overhead to requests (due to JSON
parsing mostly), we're already making refines to take that down to 5ms or even less.

<SectionItemComponent topic='First results' />
That‚Äôs fine and all, but what‚Äôs so cool at the end of the day about this platform? We‚Äôve seen already numerous
examples of ‚Äúlow-code‚Äù platforms and we're surely not re-inventing the wheel.
The first difference is that Conduit is not meant simply for citizen developers or for front-end devs that don't want to create their own backend server.
It is a platform that wants to allow anyone to configure a robust and scalable backend system, while providing limitless
possibilities to professional developers. If you are a front-end developer you can have an awesome backend solution with out-of-the-box
functionality, and if you are a backend developer you can leave the "boring" stuff to Conduit and create the services required
for your own business-logic. And even that you can do it quicker than before due to the tons of sugar that its SDK provides.
And I wouldn't want you to just take my word for it so here are some numbers:

  - üèóÔ∏è Production software delivered so far with Conduit: 4
  - üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª Backend developers required for delivery: 1
  - üõ† Number of projects worked in parallel for that developer: 3
  - üî• Max number of requests handled by a conduit deployment, that we know of (3 instances per module): 200k (The database became the bottleneck after that)
  - ‚ö°Ô∏è Mean time to respond to a request: &lt; 100ms
  - üîÆ Production Uptime: 100%
  - üî¨ Max instance scale attempted to far: 10 instances per module (core also)

<br />
<SectionItemComponent topic='Liftoff!' />
I wouldn‚Äôt publish a project that I'm not comfortable with, so I decided to try Conduit on real production
projects. Of course it wasn‚Äôt easy since there were a lot of tests that needed to be carried out, and bugs to be fixed
as you always expect, but at the end of the day, we managed to deliver the projects, at Quintessential, with 80% less backend resources
than otherwise required, faster response times and with increasingly more secure APIs.

With Conduit the question isn‚Äôt when will the API be ready, but when do you want to use it, because it‚Äôs always ready.

So, whether you‚Äôre a startup that wants to start moving quickly towards an MVP(that you won't have to rewrite once you want to scale your product),
a software company that wants to decrease development costs or a just a developer wanting to play around with something,
go ahead and give conduit a spin.

We‚Äôre in an early stage still, so we consider Conduit to be in Alpha stage, and we plan on rolling out a SaaS
offering so that you can deploy it without having to worry about servers or updates. As with any OSS project, it would
mean the world to us if you gave us a star or even better if you joined the development process to see what awesome
things, we can have Conduit do!
