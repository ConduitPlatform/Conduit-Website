# Conduit Security

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![Secrets Tab](/img/security/security_clients_list.png)

</div>

## Features

- Proper header settings (through [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/))
- Rate limiting (currently set to 50 req/s per IP)
- Client ID / Secret (disabled by default)
- Huge body size prevention (50mb max)
- Nuclear War prevention (not really but we thought it was cool if it did)

<!-- TODO
v13:
- Add a configuration section
- Update all security client related examples and mentions
-  a) now optional
-  b) new fields
v14:
- Move into Router
-->

## Configuration

In upcoming versions you'll be able to further configure it so that you may increase rate limiting thresholds, change CORS settings and increase/decrease max body size to fit your needs.
