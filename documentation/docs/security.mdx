# Conduit Security

## Features

- Proper header settings (through [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/))
- Rate limiting (currently set to 50 req/s per IP)
- Client ID / Secret required by default
- Huge body size prevention (50mb max)
- Nuclear War prevention (not really but we thought it was cool if it did)

## The Goal
Conduit isn't really an "opinionated" platform, but there are some parts that it forces you to use. For example,
the security module is baked into Conduit with no option to remove it. It works in a way though that you don't have
any reason to want to remove it. If you do, then we've done something wrong.

As most developers are too excited with their projects to remember that there are malicious actors in the internet,
Conduit takes it upon itself to provide you with some handy pre-configure utilities, that aim to keep you a bit safer.

## Configuration
While currently it is not configurable, in the coming versions you'll be able to configure it just as any other feature.
So that you can increase rate limiting thresholds, change CORS settings, increase/decrease max body size and configure
the client id / secret mechanism to fit your needs. We're still considering allowing you to disable the mechanism altogether,
but it's an "eat your vegetables" kind of thing, it may seem tiresome at some points but it's good for you.
