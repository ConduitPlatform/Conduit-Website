# REST API

## Getting Started

Conduit exposes an HTTP server for you to perform REST requests.<br />
Said REST API is used for both user-level application requests and administrative requests.

### Performing Requests

Application routes are exposed under `CONDUIT_URL/moduleName/`.<br />
Example:<br />
The Database module accepts `GET` requests to `CONDUIT_URL/database/documents`.<br />
That's how your end-user applications would query for custom (CMS) schema documents.

Application routes make use of [Application Headers](./headers#headers-app).

Administrative routes are exposed under `CONDUIT_URL/moduleName/`<br />
Example:<br />
The Database module accepts `POST` requests to `CONDUIT_URL/admin/database/schemas`<br />
That's how Conduit's Admin Panel creates custom (CMS) schemas.

Administrative routes make use of [Administration Headers](./headers#headers-admin).

-------------------------------------------------

## Swagger

Conduit's Router automatically generates OpenAPI schemas for all of your routes to be used by Swagger.<br />
This means your REST API is fully documented and even available for interaction through Swagger UI.<br />
You may always find locate your Swagger UI pages and grab the exported JSON files through the Admin Panel's home or module pages.<br />
<ins><strong>Notice:</strong> Make sure you grab the exported files <strong>after</strong> bringing up and configuring all of your target modules 
so that they include all the relevant routes and updated params.</ins>

Swagger UI pages are exposed under [/swagger](http://localhost:3000/swagger) and [/admin/swagger](http://localhost:3000/admin/swagger) by default.<br />
Oh, and you can grab your own *swagger.json* files from [/swagger.json](http://localhost:3000/swagger.json) and [/admin/swagger.json](http://localhost:3000/admin/swagger.json).<br />
You may import these directly in any API testing app of your choice to automatically generate your personalized request collection.

Just make sure you set up all of the required h[eaders](./headers) and point your `baseUrl` variable to your http server's path (eg `http://localhost:3000`).<br />
