# GraphQL

## Getting Started

Conduit exposes a GraphQL server for you to perform GraphQL requests.<br />
You can access it through `CONDUIT_URL/graphql`.

Navigating to the above URL through your web browser should bring up GraphQL Playground.<br />
You can use that to test out your requests.

Conduit's GraphQL API is used exclusively for user-level application requests.<br />
Meaning it won't let you perform administrative actions on the backend.

## Performing Requests

Making GraphQL queries requires that you pass in the required [application request headers](./headers#headers-app).<br />
Typically, you'll need a security client id (`clientid`) as well as a security client secret (`clientsecret`).

``` json title="Basic Application Headers Example"
{
	"clientid": "19f0b8f9ec03570f75d9d28c904fd5",
	"clientsecret": "187c30c6323bcc4ada9390ac93e939422686d35fe5607c319b914728d2074b229db71a82ebdcfc5edcca818202236900517e81c02e4b270dfe4569ef8f8b3c04"
}
```

Any requests requiring user authentication additionally require that you specify an `Authorization` header containing a user authentication bearer token.<br />

``` json title="User Authentication Headers Example"
{
	"clientid": "19f0b8f9ec03570f75d9d28c904fd5",
	"clientsecret": "187c30c6323bcc4ada9390ac93e939422686d35fe5607c319b914728d2074b229db71a82ebdcfc5edcca818202236900517e81c02e4b270dfe4569ef8f8b3c04",
	"Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjYyMzQ3MjMzYTQ5ODg4MGNkOWI4MDY5ZSIsImlhdCI6MTY0NzYwNDk5OCwiZXhwIjoxNzM0MDA0OTk4fQ.D_TsIaQlMimft4CXhCo_aOs0vk6opnClxM3aFtFF4Qc"
}
```

Upon specifying your headers in the GraphQL Playground page, your route documentation should become available to you.<br />
Lets perform our first query, shall we?

<!-- TODO CHANGE EXAMPLE, CHAT HAS AUTH DEP WHICH REQUIRES EMAIL ETC -->

Let's make a query to find out which chat rooms are currently registered in our database!<br />
This should return an array containing the ids of the registered chat rooms.<br />
Make sure the [Chat module](../modules/chat) is currently online.

``` bash title="Example Request"
query getRooms($skip: Number,$limit:Number) {
	getChatRooms(skip: $skip, limit:$limit) {
		rooms {
			_id
		}
	}
}
```

``` json title="Example Query Variables"
{
  "skip": 0,
  "limit": 0
}
```

<!-- TODO EXAMPLE RESULT -->
