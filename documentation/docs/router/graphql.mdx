# GraphQL API

### Getting Started

Conduit provides an interface which you can use to make GraphQL requests.<br />
This interface can be accessed from ``` CONDUIT_URL/graphql ``` endpoint. <br />
Be careful! GraphQL API can be used only in client-based requests.You can not use graphQL to make operations
if admin privileges are  required.

### Setting up the Headers

So let's navigate to this url.<br />
This interface should be displayed to you.<br />

In order to make the docs section displayed to you, you must synchronize the interface with the server.<br />
That will happen by setting the proper headers in the headers section.<br />
See what [client headers](./headers#client-headers) are required.<br />
Let's proceed with an example of how to set properly the headers.<br />

```tsx
{
"clientid":"19f0b8f9ec03570f75d9d28c904fd5",
"clientsecret": "187c30c6323bcc4ada9390ac93e939422686d35fe5607c319b914728d2074b229db71a82ebdcfc5edcca818202236900517e81c02e4b270dfe4569ef8f8b3c04",
"masterkey":"M4ST3RK3Y",
"Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjYyMzQ3MjMzYTQ5ODg4MGNkOWI4MDY5ZSIsImlhdCI6MTY0NzYwNDk5OCwiZXhwIjoxNzM0MDA0OTk4fQ.D_TsIaQlMimft4CXhCo_aOs0vk6opnClxM3aFtFF4Qc"
}
```
Since the headers are set you are ready to make graphQL request.

## Usage

Let's make a graphQL query to find out how many chat rooms are registered in our database!<br />
This query will return an array which includes the ids of the registered chat rooms.<br />
Make sure that the chat module is online.<br />

``` bash title="GET Chat Rooms"
query getRooms($skip: Number,$limit:Number) {
	getChatRooms(skip: $skip, limit:$limit) {
		rooms {
			_id
		}
	}
}
```

``` bash title="Query Variables"
{
  "skip":0,
  "limit":0
}
```
