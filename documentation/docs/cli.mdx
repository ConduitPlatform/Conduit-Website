:::caution

Some of the following commands may not be supported on outdated Conduit deployments.<br />
To guarantee ideal compatibility, try and stick to the latest versions of Conduit and Conduit CLI.

[//]: # (TODO: CLI should be aware of these limitations and throw on unsupported deployments)

:::

# Conduit CLI

[//]: # (TODO: Screenshots)

Conduit's CLI is a multipurpose tool that's meant to facilitate your development experience and speed up your work
regardless of whether you're deploying a Conduit instance for your project, developing custom modules or even
contributing to the upstream project in your spare time.

If you treat it right, it's gonna deploy local instances of Conduit for you, provide API client library generation for
your frontend team, generate some TypeScript code for your custom modules and even handle your laundry... nah, wait I
thought we were not actually releasing this one until the next release, right?

Anyway, point is, you're most likely going to want to use this, so stick around if you wish to find out how to go about it.

## Requirements

While the use of Docker is not required for every single piece of functionality provided, for most typical use cases
you're going to [need Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) and configured so that your user is capable
of utilizing it without superuser privileges.

For Linux users, this usually means adding your user to the `docker` group.

## Installation {#installation-methods}

[//]: # (TODO: Once we add more installation options, tabs should wrap everything below, componentize and import text)

<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

``` bash
sudo npm install -g @conduitplatform/cli
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Bootstrapping Local Deployments {#cmd-deploy}

Deploys a local instance of Conduit using Docker.<br />
By default, it's going to pick the latest stable release, select MongoDB as your database engine and
bring up any modules deemed essential for a barebones configuration.

If you wish to explicitly select your target Conduit version, db type or pick and configure your module selection you
should make sure to specify `--configure` while invoking this.

``` bash title="Find out more"
npx @conduitplatform/cli deploy --help
```

## Selecting Active Deployment {#cmd-init}

Select the deployment to be used for operations such as schema and API client library generation.
You may specify any local or remote deployment regardless of how it was deployed.

``` bash title="Find out more"
npx @conduitplatform/cli init --help
```

## API Client Library Generation ${cmd-generateClient}

Generates an API client library for Conduit.<br />
Supports both REST and GraphQL APIs.<br />

``` bash title="Find out more"
npx @conduitplatform/cli generateClient --help
```

## Schema Generation {#cmd-generateSchema}

Generates a compatible Conduit schema TypeScript file based on your deployment's schemas.<br />
This command is extremely useful if you're trying to build your own custom module.<br />
Make use of Database module's CMS functionality to create a custom schema, then use this command to generate a schema file for it.

``` bash title="Find out more"
npx @conduitplatform/cli generateSchema --help
```
