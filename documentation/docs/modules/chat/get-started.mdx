# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Using the Chat requires that you already have a basic understanding of how Conduit functions.<br />
Please read the project's [main getting started guide] (TODO) before proceeding.

## Execution

##### Using Docker

```jsx
docker run ...............
```

##### Using npm

```jsx
CONDUIT_SERVER=0.0.0.0:55152 SERVICE_IP=0.0.0.0:56163 npx @conduit/cms start
```

At this point, you should have a functional Chat instance.<br />
Your users are now capable of creating, joing and utilizing chat rooms to communicate with each other.<br />
You may also create chat rooms and populate them with participants yourself using the [Admin Panel] (TODO).

-------------------------------------------------

## Using the Admin Panel

The admin panel lets you browse the available chat rooms, create new ones and preview their messages.

### Creating Rooms

While in the "Rooms" tab of the Chat administration page, click on the "Create Chat Room" button.<br />
A side pane should be brought up on your right, where you can specify your room's details.
