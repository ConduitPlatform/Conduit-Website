# Getting Started

## Where do I start?

To start sending notifications you need to create a Firebase project.<br />
Also, you have to configure the module through the admin panel.<br />
See how to configure [here](./config).<br />
Once you have the module configured,you are ready to start sending.So lets see an example.

## Send notifications

### Client App

The first thing that you have to keep in your mind is that each token is related to notification token.<br />
Actually, the notification token is the Firebase Cloud Messaging registration token.<br />
Your first job is to set up a client application
and retrieve its registration token.<br />
See how to set up client [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/js/client).

### Set notification token

After receiving the FCM registration token, you are ready to proceed.<br />
As mentioned above, each user is related to a token. In a way I lied.
You, the user, are the one to connect it through the [SetNotificationToken] (TODO) route.

### Send a message

Select the user that you want to receive the push notification and make sure that the selected user has a token assigned to himself.
