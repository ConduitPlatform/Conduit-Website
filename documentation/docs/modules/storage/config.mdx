# Configuration

Navigate to the Admin Panel storage configuration tab. <br />
Since you've done this, you'll see the **Provider** and the **Connection String** fields.<br />

## Available Options

|   Option             |   Description                                      | Default |
| :----------------:   | :-------------------------:                        | :-----: |
| Provider             | Storage provider(Azure, Google ,Local)             |  local  |
| Connection String    | Provider connection string                         | ''      |


## Update the configuration
Local storage provider means that the file system will be created under the /var/tmp folder.<br />
Provider field has two options. **Google and Azure**. <br />
So just select a provider and get the corresponding connection string. Click Save! <br />
