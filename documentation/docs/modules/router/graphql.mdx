# GraphQL API

Conduit exposes a GraphQL server for you to perform GraphQL requests.<br />
You can access it through `/graphql`.

Navigating to the above URL through your web browser should bring up GraphQL Playground.<br />
You can use that to test out your requests.

Conduit's GraphQL API is used exclusively for user-level [application requests](./router.mdx#request-types-app).<br />
Meaning it won't let you perform administrative actions on the backend.

## Performing Requests

Making GraphQL queries requires that you pass in the required [application request headers](./headers#headers-app).<br />
Typically, you'll need a security client id (`clientid`) as well as a security client secret (`clientsecret`).

``` json title="Basic Request Headers Example"
{
	"clientid": "1c0d06679f837c3958fba2724b51dc",
	"clientsecret": "9ffd3a9041bff6aabff5fa81df8175c2406baaca6c417a165f5b66a9ad1c1e4408bc4aad895126ddc0ee007332aacf842f63ebc68eddc304a902a3f8867e9902"
}
```

Any requests requiring user authentication additionally require that you specify an `Authorization` header containing a user authentication bearer token.<br />

``` json title="User Authenticated Request Headers Example"
{
	"clientid": "1c0d06679f837c3958fba2724b51dc",
	"clientsecret": "9ffd3a9041bff6aabff5fa81df8175c2406baaca6c417a165f5b66a9ad1c1e4408bc4aad895126ddc0ee007332aacf842f63ebc68eddc304a902a3f8867e9902",
	"Authorization": "JWT eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjYyMzQ3MjMzYTQ5ODg4MGNkOWI4MDY5ZSIsImlhdCI6MTY0NzYwNDk5OCwiZXhwIjoxNzM0MDA0OTk4fQ.D_TsIaQlMimft4CXhCo_aOs0vk6opnClxM3aFtFF4Qc"
}
```

Upon specifying your headers in the GraphQL Playground page, your route documentation should become available to you.<br />
Lets perform our first query, shall we?

<!-- TODO CHANGE EXAMPLE, CHAT HAS AUTH DEP WHICH REQUIRES EMAIL ETC -->

Let's make a query to find out which chat rooms are currently registered in our database!<br />
This should return an array containing the ids of the registered chat rooms.<br />
Make sure the [Chat module](../modules/chat) is currently online.

``` bash title="Example Request"
query getRooms($skip: Number,$limit:Number) {
	getChatRooms(skip: $skip, limit:$limit) {
		rooms {
			_id
		}
	}
}
```

``` json title="Example Query Variables"
{
  "skip": 0,
  "limit": 0
}
```

<!-- TODO EXAMPLE RESULT -->
