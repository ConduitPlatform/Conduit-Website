## Custom Modules {#custom-modules}

Building your own modules is entirely supported.<br />
You can build them in any language offering support for gRPC, though we only currently provide a companion SDK for TypeScript.

Uh, oh, looks like this section is currently Under Development.<br />
We'll do our best to document this as soon as possible.<br />
If you need help building your own module now, shoot us a question on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/fBqUQ23M7g).
