# Google


## Overview
In this tutorial , we'll see how the facebook authenticate works.<br />
To get started with the facebook authenticate, you have to create a facebook web application.<br />

## Configure Google

To begin the Google Authentication you need to get some credentials.<br />
So, go to your [Google Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library) and create a new project.<br />
Once you have a new project, you have to request your app credentials.<br />

On your top of your screen as you see, a **CREATE CREDENTIALS** button is appeared. Click it!<br />

![Google Type Credentials](/img/modules/authentication/tutorials/google_credentials_type.png)

Choose **OAuth Client ID** because Conduit uses OAuth2 authentication.<br />
You will also be asked for application type! Choose Web App type!<br />
Now you will be able to see your app credentials. You will only need the **Client ID** and the **Client secret**<br />

We are not done yet.Also,you need to add an **Authorized redirect URI**.<br />
Hit **http://localhost:<CONDUIT_PORT>/hook/authentication/google.**<br />

A pop-up window will be displayed to you which contain your **clientId** and your **clientSecret**.<br />

## Authenticate with Google

At this step you need to begin authorize with Google by calling the [/authentication/init/google](../api_reference/User/third_party#google) route.<br />
Open postman and make a GET request to this route.By doing this you will get a link.<br />

Open a browser and navigate to this link.<br />
If your browser has been redirected to the url which you configured everything went well and the authentication has been completed.
