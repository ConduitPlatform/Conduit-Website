In this tutorial , we'll see how the facebook authenticate works.<br />
Conduit authentication works using OAuth 2.0 protocol.<br />
To get started with the facebook authenticate, you have to create a facebook web application.<br />
Also,authentication module needs to be online.<br />

## Creating a Facebook Web App

## Setting up the configuration
***NOTE***<br />
***Do not forget to configure the facebook provider through the Admin Panel. [Click here for more](../config#third-party).<br />***
Open the app which you downloaded and navigate to the ```config.js``` file.<br />
Replace the ```clientID```, ```clientSecret```  fields with your actual facebook app credentials.<br />

## Authenticate with Facebook

To begin authenticating with Facebook you have to ask Conduit for a redirect url with the proper **scopes**<br />
So let's proceed to this using Postman!<br />

![Postman facebook init](/img/modules/authentication/tutorials/postman_facebook_init.png)

Open a browser and navigate to this url that conduit gave you!<br />
Now [/hook/authentication](../api_reference/User/third_party#facebook) route has been triggered. Actually this route is responsible for the authentication.<br />
If your browser has been redirected to the url which you configured everything went well and the authentication has been completed.<br />
