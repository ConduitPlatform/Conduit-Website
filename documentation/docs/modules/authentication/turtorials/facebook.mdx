# Facebook

## Overview
In this tutorial , we'll see how the facebook authenticate works.<br />
To get started with the facebook authenticate, you have to create a facebook web application.<br />
See here for [more](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/).<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Login with Facebook
Since you've created a facebook app, also you have to crate a nodeJS application in<br />
order Login with facebook.By doing this, you will be able to take a token which is needed to<br />
continue with the authentication.<br />
You can either make your own application or downloading it from [here](https://www.github.com/toapp).<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Setting up the configuration
***NOTE***<br />
***Do not forget to configure the facebook provider through the Admin Panel. [Click here for more](../config#third-party).<br />***
Open the app which you downloaded and navigate to the ```config.js``` file.<br />
Replace the ```clientID```, ```clientSecret```  fields with your actual facebook app credentials.<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting the Access Token


Now you are ready to login with facebook.
Just hit:<br />

```jsx
cd PATH_TO_APP
yarn
yarn start
```

Look at your console. An access token will be printed.<br />
In this step, you will be able to make a POST request to authenticate.<br />
See the facebook authenticate route [here](../api_reference/User/facebook).
