# Getting Started

## Execution

**TODO**

##### Using Docker

```jsx
docker run ...............
```

##### Using npm

```jsx
CONDUIT_SERVER=0.0.0.0:55152 SERVICE_IP=0.0.0.0:56156 npx @conduit/authentication start
```

At this point, you should have a functional Authentication instance.<br />
You can now, create and manipulate users  through the Admin Panel

-------------------------------------------------

## Using the Admin Panel

The Users tab is where manipulating takes place. From Users tab you can do CRUD operations.
