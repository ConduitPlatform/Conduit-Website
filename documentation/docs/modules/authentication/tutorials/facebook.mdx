# Facebook

In this tutorial, we'll set up Facebook authentication for Conduit.<br />
To get started, you have to create a Facebook Web Application.<br />

## Creating a Facebook Web App

Navigate to the [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) website and sign in.<br />
We'll be creating an app to be used for our Conduit authentication.

![Facebook app](/img/modules/authentication/tutorials/create_facebook_app.png)

Select Consumer app type.

Fill the application details and finalize your app!<br />

In this step, you will be asked to add products to your app. Select Facebook Login.<br />

You will be asked to select a type for your application. Select `WEB`.<br />
Select  Facebook Login.<br />

Your app is ready. Make sure you download the relevant file.

## Setting up the configuration

***NOTE***<br />
**Do not forget to configure the Facebook provider through the [Admin Panel](../config#third-party).**<br />
Open the app which you downloaded and navigate to the `config.js` file.<br />
Replace client id and client secret with your actual Facebook app credentials.<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Authenticate with Facebook

To begin authenticating with Facebook you request a redirect url with the proper scopes<br />
We'll proceed using Postman!<br />

![Postman Facebook Init](/img/modules/authentication/tutorials/postman_facebook_init.png)

Open a browser and navigate to the url returned to you from Conduit.<br />
Now [/hook/authentication](../api_reference/User/third_party#facebook) route has been triggered.<br />
Once your browser has been redirected, your authentication has been completed.
