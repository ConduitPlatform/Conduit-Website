# Applying Migrations

This tutorial is going to teach you how to implement migrations and help you adapt 
your existing schemas upon receiving new requirements, without losing any of your precious data.

### Prerequisites

This guide is a followup to the critically-acclaimed 
[Cinema Ticket Booking tutorial](1_cinema_ticket_booking.mdx).<br />
You don't really need to have used the previous tutorial to follow along, 
but you'll need a basic understanding of the module's functionalities, so make sure you've at the very 
least read the [Getting Started](../1_get-started.mdx) guide for the CMS module.

-------------------------------------------------

### Scenario

So that previous project ended up being a **üÖ±Ô∏èig Success** 
and I'm now enjoying my flashy vacation on a greek island üçπ.<br />
Life is gooood. Oof, that's my new intern assistant on the phone.

-Sir, our client just contacted us, we have some new requirements. 

Damn it!<br />
Tickets should now contain a unique identifier and support discounted prices.<br />
They even need a pointless directors bio page for stuff nobody is ever going to read! üòµ

Hey docs guy, how can I implement these changes without breaking my production site?

-Fear not fellow awesome person reading these docs. We've got you covered.

### Requirements

We are going to register two new schemas. One for our tickets and one for our directors.<br />
We'll then migrate every unique `director` from our existing `Movies` schema over to the new dedicated one.<br />
Similarly, we'll figure out a way to do the same for our `Projections` schema's `ticketsSold` field.

-------------------------------------------------

## Altering our Backend

### Creating the new Schemas

**TODO**

### Migrating our Data

**TODO**

-------------------------------------------------

## Where to go from here

A similar real world application would definitely require some form of user authentication, 
as we well as support for sending emails.<br />
We would therefore implore you to check out the respective modules:

- [Authentication](../../authentication)
- [Email](../../email)
