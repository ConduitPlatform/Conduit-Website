# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Using the Forms module requires that you already have a basic understanding of how Conduit functions.<br />
Please read the project's [main getting started guide] (TODO) before proceeding.

## Execution

**TODO**

##### Using Docker

```jsx
docker run ...............
```

##### Using npm

```jsx
CONDUIT_SERVER=0.0.0.0:55152 SERVICE_IP=0.0.0.0:56154 npx @conduit/forms start
```

At this point, you should have a functional Forms instance.<br />
You may now register forms through the [Admin Panel] (TODO).

-------------------------------------------------

## Using the Admin Panel

Lets walk you through some examples on how to utilize the Forms module through Conduit's admin panel.<br />
Start by [launching the admin panel] (TODO) and navigating to the Forms page.

On the main screen, you can see a list view of all the available forms.<br />
You may delete individual forms and view their submitted replies.<br />
You can also view a form's specification and edit its fields.
