# Cinema Ticket Booking

This is a beginner friendly tutorial intended to familiarize developers with the creation and 
utilization of custom schemas in a simple ticket booking application.

This tutorial makes use of [Conduit's REST API](../../router/rest) for CRUD operations.

### Prerequisites

Following this tutorial requires that you have already read the Database module's 
[Getting Started](../get-started.mdx) guide.<br />
Please make sure you understand the basics before resuming.

Make sure you don't disable CRUD operations or enable authentication while 
creating your schemas as this goes beyond the scope of this basic tutorial.

-------------------------------------------------

### Scenario

You are a building a ticket booking website for a cinema.<br />
You need a fast, yet efficient way to build your application's backend.

### Requirements

Your website needs to keep track of movies, halls and projections.<br />
It should also be aware of ticket availability for the latter.<br />
In order to represent each one of these through types, we need to figure out their specifications.

A movie should have a name, a director, a duration and a release date.<br />
A hall needs a name, a number of seats and a class.<br />
A projection has relation fields to a movie and a hall, as well as a datetime field and 
a counter for the tickets sold for it.

Head to the admin panel's Database page so we can begin creating our schemas.<br />

-------------------------------------------------

## Building our Backend

### Movies Schema:

Create a new schema and name it `Movies`.<br />
A movie's name is a string, so drag a text field element into the schema fields area.<br />
After the field edit pane is brought up, set its name to `name` and make it required.

Drag another text field, name it `director`, make it required and save that too.<br />
We are going to represent duration in minutes, so use a number field, name it `duration` and make that too required.<br />
At last, drag a date field into the schema area, name it `releaseDate`. Yeap, that's also required.

Our schema looks solid. Hit that save button ðŸ’¾.

Note how we used a text type for the `Movies` schemas's `director` field in 
order to keep the tutorial's complexity at check.<br />
Ideally, we would be storing the directors on a separate schema and using a relation field instead.<br />
Feel free to play around and improve on the original design after you're done.

### Halls Schema:

Create a `Halls` schema, adding three required fields.<br />
A `name` text field, a `seats` number field and a `class` enum field (of type text).<br />
Enum options are separated via new lines.

Damn, you're getting good at this.

### Projections Schema:

Last but not least, create a `Projections` schema to combine these two.<br />
Add two required relation fields. Name the first one `movie` and select `Movies` from the relation type dropdown.<br />
Now create a required `hall` field, setting its relation type to `Halls`.

![Projections Movie Relation](/img/modules/database/tutorials/cinema_tickets_booking/projections_movie_relation.png)

Use a date field to represent the `startTime` and make it required.<br />
At last, throw in a required `ticketsSold` number field with a default value of 0.

We are going to use that last one to calculate the number of tickets available for sale based on the hall's seats down the road.

-------------------------------------------------

## Testing our CRUD Endpoints

Wait that's it?<br />
Almost. Remember that `Allow CRUD operations` checkbox you definitely didn't toggle off during schema creation?<br />
Yeap. Your schemas are already exposed through [Conduit's REST API](../../router/rest).<br />
GraphQL is also supported out of the box, but we're focusing on REST for this tutorial.
