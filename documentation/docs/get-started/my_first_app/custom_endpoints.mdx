# Using Custom Endpoints

A unique feature that Conduit supports is Custom Endpoints.Given a custom created schema, this feature enables you<br />
to create custom endpoints for that schema.<br />
In this section a tutorial of how to manipulate data with custom endpoints using a Front-End framework.<br />

## Prerequisites
:::caution
You need to configure Authentication and Email module.<br />
Do not forget to enable **local Authentication** while configuring Authentication module.<br />

```

For understanding purposes we will use the [Movie Schema](../../modules/database/tutorials/cinema_ticket_booking#movies_schema) which had been created in previous tutorial.<br />
Also, some documents should be stored in the database.See the [CRUD Operations](./crud_operations#create-movie-document) tutorial to see how to do this.<br />
In addition you need to create a [custom endpoint] through the admin panel.<br />
After doing the above, you will be ready to start this tutorial.<br />

## Using Custom Endpoints

### Swagger
In order to use the Custom Endpoints be sure that the endpoints are created and ready for use.<br />
A meaningful question will be ***'How to be sure for this'*** ? <br />
Do not worry.Conduit provides a way to see the exposed API in any time using Swagger.<br />
