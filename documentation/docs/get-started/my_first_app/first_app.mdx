# Creating a React App

For understanding purposes,this section focuses on how the Conduit App works using the **REST API**.
By the end of this tutorial you will be able to understand how Conduit communicates with a Front-End framework.<br />
Let's start to create an application with the help of the ReactJs framework. You can use whatever framework you want. But in this tutorial
React will be used.

## Prerequisites
To start this tutorial it is required to have some modules running. All you need to do is to install Conduit on your local machine<br />
and have some modules online.
The required modules which are needed to be online are: ***Core,Database,Email,Authentication***.<br />
:::caution
You need to configure Authentication and Email module.<br />
Do not forget to enable **local Authentication** while configuring Authentication module.<br />

## App Initialization

Let's create a directory called `conduit_app` and create a react-app in this folder.<br />
Make sure that the npm package manager is installed in your machine.<br />
```bash title="App Initialization"
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

**Note**: ***CORE AND DATABASE MODULE SHOULD BE ONLINE***
