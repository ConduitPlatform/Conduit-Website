## Getting Conduit

9 out of 10 successful backend engineers agree downloading software drastically increases the chances of running it!<br />
The odd one is renting their backend from a megacorp, but we are not here to judge anyone, are we?<br />

There are multiple ways to get started with Conduit.<br />
You could [build it from source](https://github.com/ConduitPlatform/Conduit#running-from-source-) 
or you could use our [prebuilt container images](https://github.com/orgs/ConduitPlatform/packages?sort_by=downloads_desc&visibility=public).<br />
We'll pick the latter in this case, but feel free to choose any installation method you prefer.

If you're not going to use the automated approach listed below, make sure you're not mix and matching different major versions of 
Conduit, modules or Conduit-UI (Admin Panel), otherwise you face incompatibilities!

Conduit should solve every single one of your problems, including your carpal tunnel syndrome, no matter how you install it.<br />
Unless it won't... at this point you might wanna open a [feature request](https://github.com/ConduitPlatform/Conduit/issues/new/choose) 
or shoot us a message over on our [community platforms](https://getconduit.dev/contribute) and let us know about it.

## Bootstrapping using Containers {#container-makefile}

Conduit and all of our official modules are available as container images on the Github Container Registry.<br />
You can pull and configure them yourself however you see fit, but you don't wanna do that just to test things locally do you?<br />
Yeah, thought so. Thankfully, it just so happens we've built a handy little script to automate everything for you!

You're going to need Docker (or Podman ðŸ¦¦) and Make before proceeding.<br />
Make sure your user can execute docker commands without *sudo* (by adding it to the docker group).

``` bash
source <(curl -s https://getconduit.dev/bootstrap)
```

If you're going to use Podman, make sure you prepend the above with `export DOCKER=podman;`.

Upon completion, the above should bring up Conduit's core, a Database instance using MongoDB, the Authentication module, as well as the Administration Panel.

*Notice: This section assumes Conduit's gRPC server is running on port 3000. The Admin Panel runs on port 8080.*

At this point, you should already have a working Conduit deployment.<br />
Check out your [Admin Panel](../get-started/admin-panel.mdx) or try out the [REST](../router/rest.mdx) and [GraphQL](../router/graphql.mdx) APIs.
 
Our script is also going to download a *Makefile* to your current directory.<br />
Feel free to move it around, just keep it secret and keep it safe, for it's going to aid you in controlling your Conduit containers.

You may effortlessly start and stop additional modules, recreate and remove containers or just clean everything up in case you get bored of us ðŸ˜¢.<br />
Here's a little cheat sheet to get you started:

|  Targets          |  Description                     |
| :---------------: | :------------------------------: |
| `zero-to-hero`    | Runs `setup` and `start-conduit` |
| `setup`           | Creates container network and pulls critical images   |
| `start-conduit`   | Starts Conduit, Database, Authentication, Admin Panel |
| `start-all`       | It starts Coundit, Admin Panel and every module       |
| `stop-all`        | Stop all running containers      |
| `clean`           | Remove all containers            |
| `mrproper`        | Remove all container images and container network     |

Here's a list of all the unit targets you can individually operate on:<br />

- core
- authentication
- chat
- database (defaults to MongoDB)
- email
- forms
- push-notifications
- sms
- redis
- mongo
- postgres 

And there's the unit target modifiers available for you to start, stop and remove containers and images:

|  Target Modifier  |  Description                    |
| :---------------: | :-----------------------------: |
| `start-target`    | Start target unit               |
| `stop-target`     | Stop target unit                |
| `rm-target`       | Remove target's container       |
| `rmi-target`      | Remove target's container image |

*Example: Starting the Email module's container*

``` bash
make start-email
```

## Does this actually work?

Sure, we printed out a bunch of catchy stuff in a terminal and would you look at that? we even used emojis too!<br />
But how do you know this is actually the real deal?<br />
I mean... the panel has a dark mode! And that login page had a cool SVG... Surely that's enough to convince you?<br />
No? People are too suspicious these days ðŸ˜¢.

Why don't you have a look at our [Getting Started](../get-started) guide?<br />
It should help reassure you this is all actually legit stuff ðŸ‘Œ.
