## Conduit's Architecture

As we've mentioned Conduit runs on a micro-service-based architecture. This is done to accomplish 2 things:
- To allow for individual scaling of each service so that you can account for different traffic patterns in your application.
- So that you can spin-up and down the services you actually need without having to host all of Conduit's features
if they are not required for your use-case. For example, you could use only `Authentication`, `Database` and `Core` if you want
Conduit to only handle User authentication for you. Don't want the admin panel? Just don't spin it up.

## Core Structure
For our next magic trick we're going to render a png, observe:

<ImageSwitcher
lightImageSrc="/img/overview/architecture/core_architecture.light.png"
darkImageSrc="/img/overview/architecture/core_architecture.dark.png"
altText="Core Architecture View"
/>

<center><em>magic</em></center>

So what you can see here, is that Conduit Core, consists of `Admin` and `Config` and of course the `Core`
package. The `Core` package is simply a glue, that along with the `Commons` package you'll see in our repo,
make sure that `Admin` and `Config` start successfully and are ready to handle requests.

Requests get forwarded to each module (eg: `Authentication`) through either `Admin` on `Router`,
depending on whether it's an administrative or application request.

The config package handles configuration storage and serves as the service registry of every Conduit cluster.<br />
It knows where everyone is, if they are online, currently serving etc.

Both `Router` and the `Admin`, have separate gRPC functions that handle route registration from modules.<br />
At the end of a module's registration process, all routes are declared to either one of the above.

Application-level requests pass through `Router`'s security package, enforcing rate-limiting and
optionally performing client id/secret verification checks.

## General Architecture

Enter magic rendering number 2:

<center><em>woosh</em></center>

<ImageSwitcher
lightImageSrc="/img/overview/architecture/general_architecture.light.png"
darkImageSrc="/img/overview/architecture/general_architecture.dark.png"
altText="General Architecture View"
/>

<center><em>tada</em></center>

The rest of Conduit's architecture is rather straightforward.<br />
All modules communicate with Core AAAAND with each other.

Modules generally follow these lifecycle steps:
- Connect to Core's gRPC server
- Get your configuration from the Config service
- Spin up your own gRPC server to handle requests (optional)
- Register as a module giving the module's name and exposed address (IP:PORT or URL)

After that each module can register Routes either to the `Router` (for client-facing endpoints)
or to the `Admin` (for admin-facing endpoints).

Modules communicate with each other through gRPC without needing to go through the Core module.<br />
The Core module publishes module changes as they happen, so if for instance one module is de-activated,
all others are informed about this instantly.

The Grpc-SDK JS library we've created handles all of that automatically, by listening for these updates an initializing
connections to other modules you need as they become available.
