## Conduit's Architecture

As we've mentioned Conduit runs on a micro-service architecture. This is done to accomplish 2 things:
- To allow for individual scaling of each service so that you can account for different traffic patterns in your application.
- So that you can spin-up and down the services you actually need without having to host all of Conduit's features
if they are not required for your use-case. For example, you could use only Authentication, Database and the Core if you want
Conduit to only handle User authentication for you. Don't want the admin panel? Just don't spin it up.

## Core Structure
For our next magic trick we're going to render a png, observe:

<ImageSwitcher 
lightImageSrc="/img/overview/architecture/core_architecture.light.png"
darkImageSrc="/img/overview/architecture/core_architecture.dark.png"
altText="Core Architecture View"
/>

So what you can see here, is that the Conduit Core, consists of Router, Admin, Config, Security and of course the core
packages. The core package is simply a glue, that along with the commons package you'll see in our repo,
make sure that the Admin, the Config and the Router start successfully and are ready to handle requests.
Depending on the request,it will get forwarded to the module responsible for handling it (ex. Authentication) or
to the Admin package if it's an admin endpoint, which again will forward it to the appropriate package.

The config package handles configuration storage and serves as the service registry of every Conduit cluster. It knows where
everyone is, if they are online etc.

Both the Router and the Admin, have separate gRPC functions that handle route registration from modules. At the end of the
registration process all routes are declared to the Router and in the case of admin routes they are pre-pended with a specific
path that does additional checks for admin routes.

Every request, once received from the Router, goes through the security package which checks ClientId/Secret combinations,
and enforces rate-limiting checks.

## General Architecture

Enter magic rendering number 2:

<center><em>woosh</em></center>

<ImageSwitcher 
lightImageSrc="/img/overview/architecture/general_architecture.light.png"
darkImageSrc="/img/overview/architecture/general_architecture.dark.png"
altText="General Architecture View"
/>

<center><em>tada</em></center>

The rest of Conduit's architecture is rather straightforward. All modules communicate with the core AAAAND with each other.
Modules generally follow these lifecycle steps:
- Connect to the Core gRPC server
- Get your configuration from the Config service
- Spin up your own gRPC server to handle requests (optional)
- Register as a module giving the module's name and exposed address (IP:PORT or URL)

After that each module can register Routes either to the Router (for client-facing endpoints) or to the Admin (for admin-facing endpoints).

Modules communicate with each other through gRPC without needing to go through the Core module. The Core module publishes
module changes as they happen, so if for instance one module is de-activated, all other are informed about this instantly.

The Grpc-SDK JS library we've created handles all of that automatically, by listening for these updates an initializing
connections to other modules you need as they become available.
