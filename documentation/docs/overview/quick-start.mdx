## Getting Conduit

9 out of 10 successful backend engineers agree downloading software drastically increases the chances of running it!<br />
The odd one is renting their backend from a megacorp, but we are not here to judge anyone, are we?<br />

There are multiple ways to get started with Conduit.<br />
You could build it yourself... or you could use our prebuilt container images.<br />
We'll pick the latter in this case, but feel free to [build and configure Conduit yourself](https://github.com/ConduitPlatform/Conduit#running-from-source-).

Conduit should solve every single one of your problems, including your carpal tunnel syndrome, no matter how you install it.<br />
Unless it won't... at this point you might wanna open a [feature request](TODO) or shoot us a message over on our [community platforms](TODO) and let us know about it.

## Bootstrapping using Containers

Conduit and all of our official modules are available as container images on the Github Container Registry.<br />
You can pull and configure them yourself however you see fit, but you don't wanna do that just to test things locally do you?<br />
Yeah, thought so. Thankfully, it just so happens we've built a handy little script to automate everything for you!

You're going to need Docker and Make before proceeding.<br />
Make sure your user can execute docker commands without *sudo* (by adding it to the docker group).

``` bash
source <(curl -s https://getconduit.dev/bootstrap)
```

The script is also compatible with Podman ðŸ¦¦.<br />
Just prepend the above with `export DOCKER=podman;` and you'll be set!

Upon completion, the above should bring up Conduit's core, a Database instance using MongoDB, the Authentication module, as well as the Administration Panel.

At this point, you should already have a working Conduit deployment.<br />
Check out your Admin Panel running at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) or try out the [REST](../router/1_rest.mdx) and [GraphQL](../router/2_graphql.mdx) APIs.
 
Our script is also going to download a *Makefile* to your current directory.<br />
Feel free to move it around, just keep it secret and keep it safe, for it's going to aid you in controlling your Conduit containers.

You may effortlessly start and stop additional modules, recreate and remove containers or just clean everything up in case you get bored of us ðŸ˜¢.<br />
Here's a little cheat sheet to get you started:

|  Targets          |  Description                     |
| :---------------: | :------------------------------: |
| `zero-to-hero`    | Runs `setup` and `start-conduit` |
| `setup`           | Creates container network and pulls critical images   |
| `start-conduit`   | Starts Conduit, Database, Authentication, Admin Panel |
| `start-all`       | It starts Coundit, Admin Panel and every module       |
| `stop-all`        | Stop all running containers      |
| `clean`           | Remove all containers            |
| `mrproper`        | Remove all container images and container network     |

Here's a list of all the unit targets you can individually operate on:<br />

- core
- authentication
- chat
- database (defaults to MongoDB)
- email
- forms
- push-notifications
- sms
- redis
- mongo
- postgres 

And there's the unit target modifiers available for you to start, stop and remove containers and images:

|  Target Modifier  |  Description                    |
| :---------------: | :-----------------------------: |
| `start-target`    | Start target unit               |
| `stop-target`     | Stop target unit                |
| `rm-target`       | Remove target's container       |
| `rmi-target`      | Remove target's container image |

*Example: Starting the Email module's container*

``` bash
make start-email
```
