## Send Sms

```jsx title="Send sms"
this.grpcSdk.sms.sendSms({
    to: "+6666666666",
    message: "Hello. Conduit rocks!"
})
.catch(e => {
    ConduitGrpcSdk.Logger.error(e);
});
```

## Verify via sms

Conduit provides a verification mechanism by sending SMS. You can verify everything in two steps. <br/>
The **sendVerificationCode** function will be used to send a verification code to the user in the first step.

```jsx title="Send verification code"
const verificationSid = await this.grpcSdk.sms.sendVerificationCode({
    to: "+6666666666",
})
.catch(e => {
    ConduitGrpcSdk.Logger.error(e);
});
```

A verificationSid will be returned to you. Also, a code will be sent to the user.
To proceed to the next and final step you have to use these to make the verification

```jsx title="Verify"
const verified = await this.grpcSdk.sms.verify({
    verificationSid : "someverificationsid",
    code: "verificationcode"
})
.catch(e => {
    ConduitGrpcSdk.Logger.error(e);
})
```

If verification process went well then the returned value will be true.
