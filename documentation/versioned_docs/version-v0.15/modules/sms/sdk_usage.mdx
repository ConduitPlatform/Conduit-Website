## Send Sms

```ts title="Request"
await grpcSdk.sms.sendSms({
    to: "+6666666666",
    message: "Hello. Conduit rocks!"
})
```

## Verify via sms

Conduit provides a verification mechanism by sending SMS. You can verify everything in two steps. <br/>
The **sendVerificationCode** function will be used to send a verification code to the user in the first step.

```ts title="Request"
await grpcSdk.sms.sendVerificationCode({
    to: "+6666666666",
})
```

```ts title="Response"
{
    "verificationSid": string
}
```

A verificationSid will be returned to you. Also, a code will be sent to the user.
To proceed to the next and final step you have to use these to make the verification

```ts title="Request"
await grpcSdk.sms.verify({
    verificationSid : "someverificationsid",
    code: "verificationcode"
})
```

```ts title="Response"
{
    "verfied": boolean,
}
```
If verification process went well then the returned value will be true.
