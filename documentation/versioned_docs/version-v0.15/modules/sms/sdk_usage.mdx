# SDK Usage


## Send Sms
Underworld has to know about Conduit Platform. Just text him via sms.

:::caution
Sms module has to be configured with the proper provider.
:::
```jsx title="Send sms"
    this.grpcSdk.sms.sendSms({
        to: "+6666666666",
        message: "Hello. Conduit rocks!"
    })
    .catch(e => {
        ConduitGrpcSdk.Logger.error(e);
    })
```

## Verify via Sms

Conduit provides a verification mechanism by sending sms. You can verify everything in two steps. <br/>
In the first step, a verification code will be sent to a user using the **sendVerificationCode** function.

```jsx title="Send verification code"
const verificationSid = await this.grpcSdk.sms.sendVerificationCode({
    to: "+6666666666",
})
.catch(e => {
    ConduitGrpcSdk.Logger.error(e);
})
```

A verificationSid will be returned to you. Also, a code will be sent to the user.
To proceed to the next and final step you have to use these to make the verification.


```jsx title="Verify"
const verified = await this.grpcSdk.sms.verify({
    verificationSid : "someverificationsid",
    code: "verificationcode"
})
.catch(e => {
    ConduitGrpcSdk.Logger.error(e);
})
```

If verification process went well then the returned value will be true.
