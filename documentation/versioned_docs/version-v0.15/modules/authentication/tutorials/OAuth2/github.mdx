# Github

In this tutorial, we'll be setting up GitHub authentication for Conduit.<br />

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, you should have a GitHub account and a Conduit application set up. If you don't, head over to the [Getting Started](../../get-started) section to get set up.

## Setting up GitHub OAuth

To set up GitHub OAuth, you'll need to create a new OAuth application on GitHub. You can do this by going to [GitHub's developer settings](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) and clicking the "New OAuth App" button.


You'll need to fill out the form with the following information:

- **Application name**: This is the name of your application. It can be anything you want.
- **Homepage URL**: This is the URL of your application's homepage. It can be anything you want.
- **Authorization callback URL**: This is the URL that GitHub will redirect to after the user has authenticated.
- **Application description**: This is a description of your application. It can be anything you want.
- **Organization name**: This is the name of your organization. It can be anything you want.
- **Organization website**: This is the URL of your organization's website. It can be anything you want.

Once you've filled out the form, click the "Register application" button. You'll be redirected to the application's settings page.


You'll need to copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the application's settings page. You'll need these later.

## Configuring Conduit

Now that you have your GitHub OAuth application set up, you'll need to configure Conduit to use it. To do this, you'll need to set the clientId and client secret.
Go to the Authentication -> SIGN IN METHODS and select the GitHub provider.<br />
Then, fill the required fields you obtained from the GitHub App.

## Authenticate with GitHub

To begin authenticating with GitHub you request a redirect url with the proper scopes<br />

```bash title="Request"
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:3000/authentication/init/github' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjYzNjNjZGNkMDhkNTU2MDk1NmM4MGQ4OSIsImlhdCI6MTY2OTgwMjc0MCwiZXhwIjoxNjY5ODc0NzQwfQ._Q5rzo-FJ7gLesdaKV13dXi9aMNpGZA_nGpNJfkov3Y'
```

```json title="Response"
{
  "result": "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=1ceec70018979ba780ab&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/hook/authentication/github&response_type=code&response_mode=query&scope=read:user,repo&code_challenge=undefined&code_challenge_method=undefined&state=8eb67451-edbd-4248-8613-c36727070a78"
}
```

Open a browser and navigate to this link.<br />
If your browser has been redirected to the url which you configured everything went well and the authentication has been completed.<br />
You can now use the token to access the API.
