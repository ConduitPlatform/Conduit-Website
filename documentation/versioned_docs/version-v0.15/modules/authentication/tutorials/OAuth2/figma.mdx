# Figma

Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based, with additional offline features enabled by desktop applications for macOS and Windows.<br />
Figma is primarily focused on user interface and user experience design, and supports collaborative editing.

In this tutorial, we'll set up Figma authentication for Conduit.<br />

## Prerequisites

- [Conduit](https://getconduit.dev)
- [Figma account](https://www.figma.com/)
- [Figma Personal Access Token](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#auth)

## Create a new Figma app

1. Go to [Figma Developer](https://www.figma.com/developers/apps) and click on the **New App** button.
2. Enter a name for your app and click on the **Create App** button.
3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and save them for later.

## Setting up the configuration

***NOTE***<br />
**Do not forget to configure the Figma provider through the [Admin Panel](../../config#third-party-providers).**<br />
Go to the Authentication -> SIGN IN METHODS and select the Figma provider.<br />
Then, fill the required fields you obtained from the Figma App.

## Authenticate with Figma

To begin authenticating with Figma you request a redirect url with the proper scopes<br />

``` bash title="Request"
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:3000/authentication/figma'
```

``` json title="Response"
{
  "result": "https://www.figma.com/oauth?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fauthentication%2Ffigma%2Fcallback&scope=file_read&state=YOUR_STATE"
}
```

Open a browser and navigate to the url returned to you from Conduit.<br />
Now the `/hook/authentication` route has been triggered.<br />
Once your browser has been redirected, your authentication has been completed.
