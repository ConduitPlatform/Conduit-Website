# Google

In this tutorial, we'll be setting up Google authentication for Conduit.<br />
Before we begin, we'll need to create a Google Application.

## Configure Google

To begin the Google Authentication you need to get some credentials.<br />
Go to your [Google Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library) and create a new project.<br />
Once you have a new project, you have to request your app credentials.

Click the `CREATE CREDENTIALS` button at the top of the page.

Choose **OAuth Client ID**.<br />
You will also be asked for an application type. Choose `Web App`.<br />
Your application credentials have been generated.<br />
You will only need the client id and client secret.<br />

You need to add an **Authorized redirect URI**.<br />
Hit **http://localhost:<CONDUIT_PORT>/hook/authentication/google.**<br />

A pop-up window will be displayed to you which contain your client id and client secret.<br />

## Authenticate with Google


To begin authenticating with Google you request a redirect url with the proper scopes<br />

``` bash title="Request"
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:3000/authentication/init/google'
```

``` json title="Response"
{
    "result": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fhook%2Fauthentication%2Fgoogle&response_type=code&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.email+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.profile&access_type=offline&state=eyJpZCI6IjYzN
}
```

Open a browser and navigate to the url returned to you from Conduit.<br />
Now the `/hook/authentication` route has been triggered.<br />
Once your browser has been redirected, your authentication has been completed.
