# Reddit

Reddit is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website.<br />
It provides third party oAuth2 authentication.
In this tutorial, we will set up Reddit as an authentication provider for Conduit.<br />

## Create a Reddit App

1. Go to [Reddit Apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) and click on the **create an app** button.
2. Fill in the details as shown below and click on the **create app** button.
3. Copy the **client id** and **client secret** and save it for later use.


## Setting up the configuration

***NOTE***<br />
**Do not forget to configure the Reddit provider through the [Admin Panel](../../config#third-party-providers).**<br />
Go to the Authentication -> SIGN IN METHODS and select the Reddit provider.<br />
Then, fill the required fields you obtained from the Reddit App.

## Authenticate with Reddit

To begin authenticating with Reddit you request a redirect url with the proper scopes<br />

```bash title="Request"
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:3000/authentication/init/reddit' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjYzNjNjZGNkMDhkNTU2MDk1NmM4MGQ4OSIsImlhdCI6MTY2OTcyODgwOCwiZXhwIjoxNjY5ODAwODA4fQ._bHzQ7t2NuOiupEbWX25R_jCShev8Av3PSZW5mOPlaI'
```

```json title="Response"
{
 "result": "https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&duration=permanent&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fhook%2Fauthentication&response_type=code&scope=identity&state=STATE"
}
```

Open a browser and navigate to the url returned to you from Conduit.
Now the /hook/authentication route has been triggered.
Once your browser has been redirected, your authentication has been completed.
