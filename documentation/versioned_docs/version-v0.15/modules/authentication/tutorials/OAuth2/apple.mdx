# Apple

In this tutorial, we'll set up Apple authentication for Conduit.<br />
Apple authentication is a way for users to sign in to your app using their Apple ID.
Apple authentication provides a secure and private way for users to sign in to your app.

This provider is a little different from the others.<br />
You'll need to have an Apple Developer account and an Apple App ID.<br />

Go to the Authentication -> SIGN IN METHODS and select the Apple provider.<br />
Then, fill the required fields with the values you got from the previous steps.

- `clientId` - The client id that you created in the previous step.
- `redirect_uri` - The uri that the user will be redirected to, on successful Apple login, when using the redirect method.
- `privateKey` - The private key that you created in the previous step.
- `teamId` - The team id that you copied in the previous step.

Enable Apple Provider and click on `Save`.

## Authenticate with Apple

Now that you have configured the Apple provider, you can authenticate with it.

### Redirect Method

The redirect method is the easiest way to authenticate with Apple.<br />
It will redirect the user to the Apple login page, where they can sign in with their Apple ID.<br />
After signing in, the user will be redirected back to your app.<br />
To begin authenticating with Bitbucket you request a redirect url with the proper scopes<br />

``` bash title="Request"
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:3000/authentication/apple' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjYzNjNjZGNkMDhkNTU2MDk1NmM4MGQ4OSIsImlhdCI6MTY2OTIxMDM1MywiZXhwIjoxNjY5MjgyMzUzfQ.TyvHCuyDKLiKFoEpaXRdbYoFwrzDlFiW4VdUVQJdf7U'
```
``` json title="Response"
{
    "result": "https://appleid.apple.com/auth/authorize?client_id=io.conduit.app&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fauthentication%2Fapple%2Fcallback&response_type=code%20id_token&response_mode=form_post&scope=name%20email&state=eyJpZCI6IjYzNjNjZGNkMDhkNTU2MDk1NmM4MGQ4OSIsImlhdCI6MTY2OTIxMDM1MywiZXhwIjoxNjY5MjgyMzUzfQ.TyvHCuyDKLiKFoEpaXRdbYoFwrzDlFiW4VdUVQJdf7U&nonce=eyJpZCI6IjYzNjNjZGNkMDhkNTU2MDk1NmM4MGQ4OSIsImlhdCI6MTY2OTIxMDM1MywiZXhwIjoxNjY5MjgyMzUzfQ.TyvHCuyDKLiKFoEpaXRdbYoFwrzDlFiW4VdUVQJdf7U"
}
```


Open a browser and navigate to the url returned to you from Conduit.<br />
Now the `/hook/authentication` route has been triggered.<br />
Once your browser has been redirected, your authentication has been completed.
