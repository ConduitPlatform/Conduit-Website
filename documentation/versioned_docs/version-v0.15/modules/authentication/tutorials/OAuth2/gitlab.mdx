# GitLab

In this tutorial, we'll set up GitLab authentication for Conduit.<br />

## Prerequisites

- A Conduit project ðŸ˜Ž
- A GitLab account

## Step 1: Create a new application

Log in to your GitLab account and go to your [profile settings](https://gitlab.com).<br />

Click on the "New application" button and fill in the form as follows:

- Name: `The_name_of_your_conduit_project`
- Redirect URI: `The_url_of_your_conduit_project`
- Scopes: `The_scopes_you_need`


Click on the "Create application" button to create the application.<br />

## Step 2: Setting up the configuration

**Do not forget to configure the GitLab provider through the [Admin Panel](../../config#third-party-providers).**<br />
Go to the Authentication -> SIGN IN METHODS and select the GitLab provider.<br />
Then, fill the required fields you obtained from the GitLab App.

## Step 3: Authenticate with GitLab

To begin authenticating with GitLab you request a redirect url with the proper scopes<br />

``` bash title="Request"
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:3000/authentication/init/gitlab'
```

``` json title="Response"
{
    "result": "https://gitlab.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=1&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fauthentication%2Fcallback%2Fgitlab&response_type=code&scope=read_user+read_api+read_repository+openid+profile+email&state=eyJpZCI6IjYzN
}
```

Open a browser and navigate to the url returned to you from Conduit.<br />
Now the `/hook/authentication` route has been triggered.<br />
Once your browser has been redirected, your authentication has been completed.
