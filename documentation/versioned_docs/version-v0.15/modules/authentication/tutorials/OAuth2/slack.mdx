# Slack

Slack is a cloud-based set of team collaboration tools and services.<br />
Slack is a proprietary business communication platform which offers a range of features, including persistent chat rooms organized by topic,
private groups, and direct messaging.
Slack is available on desktop and mobile devices, as well as via third-party apps that integrate its API with other web services.

## Prerequisites

* A Slack account
* A Slack workspace
* A Slack channel

## Installation

### 1. Create a Slack App

To create a Slack App, go to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click on the **Create New App** button.



## Setting up the configuration

***NOTE***<br />
**Do not forget to configure the Slack provider through the [Admin Panel](../config#third-party).**<br />
Go to the Authentication -> SIGN IN METHODS and select the Slack provider.<br />
Then, fill the required fields you obtained from the Slack App.

## Authenticate with Slack

To begin authenticating with Slack you request a redirect url with the proper scopes<br />

``` bash title="Request"
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:3000/authentication/init/slack' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjYzNjNjZGNkMDhkNTU2MDk1NmM4MGQ4OSIsImlhdCI6MTY2OTIxMDM1MywiZXhwIjoxNjY5MjgyMzUzfQ.TyvHCuyDKLiKFoEpaXRdbYoFwrzDlFiW4VdUVQJdf7U'
```
``` json title="Response"
{
  "result": https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=1234567890.1234567890&scope=identity.basic&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/authentication/callback/slack&state=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjYzNjNjZGNkMDhkNTU2MDk1NmM4MGQ4OSIsImlhdCI6MTY2OTIxMDM1MywiZXhwIjoxNjY5MjgyMzUzfQ.TyvHCuyDKLiKFoEpaXRdbYoFwrzDlFiW4VdUVQJdf7U
}
```

Open a browser and navigate to the url returned to you from Conduit.
Now the /hook/authentication route has been triggered.
Once your browser has been redirected, your authentication has been completed.
