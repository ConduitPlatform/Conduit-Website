# LinkedIn

In this tutorial, we'll set up LinkedIn authentication for Conduit.<br />



## Step 1: Set up LinkedIn authentication

To set up LinkedIn authentication, we'll need to add the LinkedIn provider to our project.

## Creating a LinkedIn Web App

To create a LinkedIn Web App, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps) and log in with your LinkedIn account.
2. Click **Create App**.
3. Enter a name for your app and click **Create App**.
4. Click **Edit** next to **OAuth 2.0 settings**.
5. Add `your_redirect_url` to the **Authorized redirect URLs** field.
6. Click **Save**.

## Adding the LinkedIn Provider

***NOTE***<br />
**Do not forget to configure the LinkedIn provider through the [Admin Panel](../../config#third-party-providers).**<br />
Go to the Authentication -> SIGN IN METHODS and select the LinkedIn provider.<br />
Then, fill the required fields you obtained from the LinkedIn App.

## Authenticate with LinkedIn

To begin authenticating with LinkedIn you request a redirect url with the proper scopes<br />

``` bash title="Request"
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:3000/authentication/linkedin'
```

``` json title="Response"
{
    "result": "https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization?response_type=code&client_id=123456789&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fauthentication%2Flinkedin%2Fcallback&state=eyJpZCI6IjYzN
}
```

Open a browser and navigate to the url returned to you from Conduit.<br />
Now the `/hook/authentication` route has been triggered.<br />
Once your browser has been redirected, your authentication has been completed.
