# Linkedin

In this tutorial, we'll set up LinkedIn authentication for Conduit.<br />

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- A LinkedIn account
- A Conduit account
- A Conduit project set up
- A LinkedIn app set up

## Step 1: Set up LinkedIn authentication

To set up LinkedIn authentication, we'll need to add the LinkedIn provider to our project.

## Creating a LinkedIn Web App

To create a LinkedIn Web App, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps) and log in with your LinkedIn account.
2. Click **Create App**.
3. Enter a name for your app and click **Create App**.
4. Click **Edit** next to **OAuth 2.0 settings**.
5. Add `your_redirect_url` to the **Authorized redirect URLs** field.
6. Click **Save**.

## Adding the LinkedIn Provider

***NOTE***<br />
**Do not forget to configure the LinkedIn provider through the [Admin Panel](../config#third-party).**<br />
Go to the Authentication -> SIGN IN METHODS and select the LinkedIn provider.<br />
Then, fill the required fields you obtained from the LinkedIn App.

## Authenticate with LinkedIn

Open a browser and navigate to the url returned to you from Conduit.<br />
Now the `/hook/authentication` route has been triggered.<br />
Once your browser has been redirected, your authentication has been completed.
