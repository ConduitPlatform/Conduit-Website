# Figma

Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based, with additional offline features enabled by desktop applications for macOS and Windows.<br />
Figma is primarily focused on user interface and user experience design, and supports collaborative editing.

In this tutorial, we'll set up Figma authentication for Conduit.<br />

## Prerequisites

- [Conduit](https://getconduit.dev)
- [Figma account](https://www.figma.com/)
- [Figma Personal Access Token](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#auth)

## Create a new Figma app

1. Go to [Figma Developer](https://www.figma.com/developers/apps) and click on the **New App** button.
2. Enter a name for your app and click on the **Create App** button.
3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and save them for later.

## Setting up the configuration

***NOTE***<br />
**Do not forget to configure the Figma provider through the [Admin Panel](../config#third-party).**<br />
Go to the Authentication -> SIGN IN METHODS and select the Figma provider.<br />
Then, fill the required fields you obtained from the Figma App.

## Authenticate with Figma

Now that you have set up the configuration, you can authenticate with Figma.<br />

Open a browser and navigate to the url returned to you from Conduit.<br />
Now the `/hook/authentication` route has been triggered.<br />
Once your browser has been redirected, your authentication has been completed.
