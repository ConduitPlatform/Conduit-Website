# Twitch

In this tutorial, we will set up Twitch as an authentication provider for Conduit.<br />

## Prerequisites

- A Twitch account
- A Conduit project

## Create a Twitch App

1. Go to the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) and click on the **Register Your Application** button.
2. Fill in the form and click on the **Register** button.
3. On the next page, click on the **Manage** button.
4. On the next page, click on the **New Secret** button.
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and save them for later.

## Setting up the configuration

***NOTE***<br />
**Do not forget to configure the Twitch provider through the [Admin Panel](../config#third-party).**<br />
Go to the Authentication -> SIGN IN METHODS and select the Twitch provider.<br />
Then, fill the required fields you obtained from the Twitch App.

## Authenticate with Twitch

[//]: # (TODO Twitch photos)

Open a browser and navigate to the url returned to you from Conduit.<br />
Now the `/hook/authentication` route has been triggered.<br />
Once your browser has been redirected, your authentication has been completed.
