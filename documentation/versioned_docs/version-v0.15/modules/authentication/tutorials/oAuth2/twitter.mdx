# Twitter

In this tutorial, we will learn how to set up Twitter as an authentication provider for Conduit.<br />

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to have a Twitter account and a Twitter app. If you don't have a Twitter account, you can create one [here](https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup).<br />
If you don't have a Twitter app, you can create one [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps).<br />

## Setting up Twitter

### Step 1: Create a Twitter app

1. Go to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps) and log in with your Twitter account.
2. Click on the **Create an app** button.
3. Fill in the required details and click on the **Create** button.

### Step 2: Configure the Twitter app

1. Go to the **Keys and tokens** tab and copy the **API key** and **API secret key**.
2. Go to the **Settings** tab and enable **Allow this application to be used to Sign in with Twitter**.
3. Go to the **App permissions** tab and enable the permissions you want to use.

### Step 3: Configure the Twitter provider

1. Go to the **Authentication** tab and click on the **SIGN IN METHODS**.
2. Select **Twitter** from the list of providers.
3. Paste the **API key** and **API secret key** from the **Keys and tokens** tab of the Twitter app.
4. Enable the twitter provider and click on the **Save** button.

## Authenticate with Twitter

To begin authenticating with Twitter you request a redirect url with the proper scopes<br />
We'll proceed using Postman!<br />

[//]: # (![Postman Twitter Init]&#40;/v0.15/modules/authentication/tutorials/postman_Twitter_init.png&#41;)

Open a browser and navigate to the url returned to you from Conduit.<br />
Now the `/hook/authentication` route has been triggered.<br />
Once your browser has been redirected, your authentication has been completed.
