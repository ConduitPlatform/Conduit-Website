# Bitbucket

Bitbucket is a web-based version control repository hosting service owned by Atlassian, for source code and development projects.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to set up Bitbucket as an authentication provider for Conduit.<br />

## Prerequisites

* A Bitbucket account
* A Conduit instance

## Create a Bitbucket App

1. Log in to your Bitbucket account and go to the [Bitbucket settings](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/).
2. Click on the **Create app password** button.
3. Enter a label for the app password and click on the **Create** button.
4. Copy the generated app password.
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Bitbucket app you created to use in the next step.

## Configure Bitbucket as an authentication provider

***NOTE***<br />
**Do not forget to configure the Bitbucket provider through the [Admin Panel](../config#third-party).**<br />
Go to the Authentication -> SIGN IN METHODS and select the Bitbucket provider.<br />
Then, fill the required fields you obtained from the Bitbucket App.

## Authenticate with Bitbucket

[//]: # (TODO Bitbucket photos)

Open a browser and navigate to the url returned to you from Conduit.<br />
Now the `/hook/authentication` route has been triggered.<br />
Once your browser has been redirected, your authentication has been completed.
