# Reddit

Reddit is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website.<br />
It provides third party oAuth2 authentication.
In this tutorial, we will set up Reddit as an authentication provider for Conduit.<br />

## Create a Reddit App

1. Go to [Reddit Apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) and click on the **create an app** button.
2. Fill in the details as shown below and click on the **create app** button.
3. Copy the **client id** and **client secret** and save it for later use.

## Setting up the configuration

***NOTE***<br />
**Do not forget to configure the Reddit provider through the [Admin Panel](../config#third-party).**<br />
Go to the Authentication -> SIGN IN METHODS and select the Reddit provider.<br />
Then, fill the required fields you obtained from the Reddit App.

## Authenticate with Reddit

To begin authenticating with Reddit you request a redirect url with the proper scopes<br />
We'll proceed using Postman!<br />

[//]: # (![Postman Reddit Init]&#40;/v0.15/modules/authentication/tutorials/postman_Reddit_init.png&#41;)

Open a browser and navigate to the url returned to you from Conduit.<br />
Now the `/hook/authentication` route has been triggered.<br />
Once your browser has been redirected, your authentication has been completed.
