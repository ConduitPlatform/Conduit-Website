# Github

In this tutorial, we'll be setting up GitHub authentication for Conduit.<br />

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, you should have a GitHub account and a Conduit application set up. If you don't, head over to the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) section to get set up.

## Setting up GitHub OAuth

To set up GitHub OAuth, you'll need to create a new OAuth application on GitHub. You can do this by going to [GitHub's developer settings](/settings/developers) and clicking the "New OAuth App" button.

[//]: # (![GitHub OAuth App]&#40;/img/docs/github-oauth-app.png&#41;)

You'll need to fill out the form with the following information:

- **Application name**: This is the name of your application. It can be anything you want.
- **Homepage URL**: This is the URL of your application's homepage. It can be anything you want.
- **Authorization callback URL**: This is the URL that GitHub will redirect to after the user has authenticated. It should be `http://localhost:4000/auth/github/callback` if you're using the default port for Conduit.
- **Application description**: This is a description of your application. It can be anything you want.
- **Organization name**: This is the name of your organization. It can be anything you want.
- **Organization website**: This is the URL of your organization's website. It can be anything you want.

Once you've filled out the form, click the "Register application" button. You'll be redirected to the application's settings page.

You'll need to copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the application's settings page. You'll need these later.

## Configuring Conduit

Now that you have your GitHub OAuth application set up, you'll need to configure Conduit to use it. To do this, you'll need to set the clientId and client secret.
Go to the Authentication -> SIGN IN METHODS and select the GitHub provider.<br />
Then, fill the required fields you obtained from the GitHub App.

## Authenticate with GitHub

Now that you've configured Conduit to use GitHub OAuth, you can authenticate with GitHub.

[//]: # (![Sign in with GitHub]&#40;/img/docs/sign-in-with-github.png&#41;)

You'll be redirected to GitHub's authentication page. You'll need to enter your GitHub username and password to authenticate.
