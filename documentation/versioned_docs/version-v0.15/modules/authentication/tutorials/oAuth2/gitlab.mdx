# Gitlab

In this tutorial, we'll set up Gitlab authentication for Conduit.<br />

## Prerequisites

- A Conduit project
- A Gitlab account

## Step 1: Create a new application

Log in to your Gitlab account and go to your [profile settings](https://gitlab.com/profile/applications).<br />

Click on the "New application" button and fill in the form as follows:

- Name: `The_name_of_your_conduit_project`
- Redirect URI: `The_url_of_your_conduit_project`
- Scopes: `The_scopes_you_need`

[//]: # (![Gitlab application form]&#40;/img/tutorials/gitlab/gitlab-application-form.png&#41;)

Click on the "Create application" button to create the application.<br />

## Step 2: Setting up the configuration

**Do not forget to configure the Gitlab provider through the [Admin Panel](../config#third-party).**<br />
Go to the Authentication -> SIGN IN METHODS and select the Gitlab provider.<br />
Then, fill the required fields you obtained from the Gitlab App.

## Step 3: Authenticate with Gitlab

[//]: # (![Gitlab login]&#40;/img/tutorials/gitlab/gitlab-login.png&#41;)

Open a browser and navigate to the url returned to you from Conduit.<br />
Now the `/hook/authentication` route has been triggered.<br />
Once your browser has been redirected, your authentication has been completed.
