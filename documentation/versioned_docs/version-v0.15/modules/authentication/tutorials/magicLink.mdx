# Magic link

MagicLink is a simple way to authenticate users without requiring them to enter a password.<br />
It works by sending a one-time login link to the user's email address. When the user clicks the link, they are logged in to your app.

## How it works

MagicLink is a two-step process:

1. The user enters their email address and clicks the "Send MagicLink" button.
2. The user receives an email with a link to log in to your app. When they click the link, they are logged in to your app.

## Set up Magic-link authentication

To set up Magic-link authentication, you need to go to Authentication -> Sign in method and enable the Magic-link authentication.
The redirect uri is not required, but if it is provided, it must be a valid url.
It is used to redirect the user to a specific page after they have verified their email
