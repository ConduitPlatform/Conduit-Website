# Secure your account with Two-Factor Authentication

## What is Two-Factor Authentication?

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a method of confirming your identity by using two different methods.<br />
The first method is your password, and the second method is a code that is sent to your phone.<br />
This code is only valid for a short period of time, and it is only valid for one login attempt.<br />
This means that even if someone gets your password, they will not be able to log in to your account without also having access to your phone.<br />
In conduit, we support two-factor authentication using phone based authentication and qr code based authentication.<br />
