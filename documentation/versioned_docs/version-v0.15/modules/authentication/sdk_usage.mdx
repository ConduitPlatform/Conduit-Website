# SDK Usage


## User Login
This sdk function produces login credentials for a user without them having to login.
It is required a user and a client have been created.
```jsx title="User login"
await this.grpcSdk.authentication.userLogin({
    userId: "someuserid",
    clientId : "someclientid"
})
.catch(e => {
    ConduitGrpcSdk.Logger.error(e);
});

```

## User Create
It is necessary to explain how a user is created using Conduit sdk.
Each sdk user has the option to decide whenever a user will be verified or not.<br />
In case that **verify** parameter is set to **true** then the user will be under a verification process in order to signup successfully.
The second step of the verification process depend on the configuration of the local strategy. The **send verification email** option should be selected.

:::caution

If the [email module is not up and configured](../email/config) or the [send verification email](./config#local-authentication) option is not selected then the process will fail .<br />
:::

```jsx title="User login"
await this.grpcSdk.authentication.userCreate({
    email: "somemai@example.com",
    password : "P@$$w0rd",
    verify: true | false
})
.catch(e => {
    ConduitGrpcSdk.Logger.error(e);
});

```


## User Delete

No words needed to explain this sdk function usage. The only thing you need is the **userId** that you want to delete.

```jsx title="User delete"
await this.grpcSdk.authentication.userDelete({
    userId: "someuserid"
})
.catch(e => {
    ConduitGrpcSdk.Logger.error(e);
});

```

## Change Password

No explanation needed either. Just type the new password and the email of the user, and you are ready.

```jsx title="Change user's password "
await this.grpcSdk.authentication.changePass({
    email: "somemai@example.com",
    password: "newP@$$w0rd"
})
.catch(e => {
    ConduitGrpcSdk.Logger.error(e);
});

```
