# SDK Usage


## User Login
Without requiring the user to log in first, this SDK function generates login credentials for them.
A user and a client must both have been created.

```ts title="Request"
await grpcSdk.authentication.userLogin({
    userId: "someuserid",
    clientId : "someclientid"
})
```

```ts title="Response"
{
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjYyNDJmMWJiMTBhMDk5MDE4Mjc3MzhmZSIsImlhdCI6MTY0ODU1NDUyNywiZXhwIjoxNzM0OTU0NTI3fQ.Fjqa7ORBBF2giwG7OgiWr2HMgHDL7R6ddFq2E730Djc",
    "refreshToken": "BsKhe3ARhL/FfDfK1REphKkkqQaxRCj/LvvRHOg5wCXCBaUSOwafRHyFYIttaORY/NmHS7NAuT6+knBQegVOwQ=="
}
```

## User Create
It is necessary to explain how Conduit sdk is used to create a user.
As in dev, you can choose whether to verify a user when using the SDK.<br />
Sign up verification can also be enabled by sending an email.

:::caution
If the [email module is not up and configured](../email/config) or the [send verification email](./config#local-authentication) option is not selected then the process will fail .<br />
:::

```ts title="Request"
await grpcSdk.authentication.userCreate({
    email: "somemail@example.com",
    password : "P@$$w0rd",
    verify: true,
})
```


## User Delete

No words needed to explain this sdk function usage. The only thing you need is the **userId** that you want to delete.

```ts title="Request"
await grpcSdk.authentication.userDelete({
    userId: "someuserid"
})
```

## Change Password

No explanation needed either. Just type the new password and the email of the user, and you are ready.

```ts title="Request"
await grpcSdk.authentication.changePass({
    email: "somemail@example.com",
    password: "newP@$$w0rd"
})
```
