# SDK Usage

Depending on the configured provider, Conduit SDK provides push notification utilities.For now, only Firebase and OneSignal providers are implemented. <br />
As it was mentioned before, push notifications are sent to applications that are related to users.
In fact, a user is related to a notification token, and a token is related to an application.
A notification token is a unique identifier generated for a user, and thus for an application as well.
For instance, the Firebase messaging system provides tokens for sending push notifications. <br />
Conduit represents these tokens as objects, which include three subfields.

In detail:

```jsx title="Notification Token Object"
{
    _id: ObjectId,
    userId: ObjectId, //user's Id related with this token,
    token: string, // actual token related with the application
    platform: string, // application platform
}
```


## Set notification token

A reasonable question is "How is a notification token related to a user?" Conduit has the answer for you.
Using the **setNotificationToken()** SDK function, you can "relate" a token to a user.


```jsx title=" Set notification token"
await this.grpcSdk.pushNotifications.setNotificationToken({
    token: "applicationtoken",
    platform: "WEB", // could be also ANDROID,IOS,MACOS,LINUX,CLI,IPADOS
    userId: "someuserid", // user related with this token
})
.catch(e => {
    ConduitGrpcSdk.Logger.error(e);
});
```

## Get notification token

Getting a user's notification token will be an easy process. Just call getNotificationTokens() function.
```jsx title=" Get notification tokens"
const tokens = await this.grpcSdk.pushNotifications.getNotificationTokens({
    userId: "someuserid", // user related with this token
})
.catch(e => {
    ConduitGrpcSdk.Logger.error(e);
});
```
Response will include an array of Notification Token Object

```jsx title="Response"
tokens: [{
    _id: ObjectId,
    userId: ObjectId, //user's Id related with this token,
    token: string, // actual token related with the application
    platform: string, // application platform
}]
```

## Send Notification

Congratulations! You are now ready to send push notifications.

```jsx title="Send notification"
const response= await this.grpcSdk.pushNotifications.sendNotification({
    sendTo: "diresuemos",
    title: "Hello 666.I have a message for you.",
    body: "Conduit will send you to heaven.Try it."
})
.catch(e => {
    ConduitGrpcSdk.Logger.error(e);
});
```
Appropriate message will be returned to you if everything went well.
```jsx title="Response"
response: {
    message: "Ok"
}
```

## Send many notifications

There is a "plus" function for sending push notifications to many users concurrently.
```jsx title="Send Notifications"
await this.grpcSdk.pushNotifications.sendToManyDevices({
    sendTo: ["diresuemos","somueserid2","someuserid3"],
    title: "Hello 666.I have a message for you.",
    body: "Conduit will send you to heaven.Try it."
})
.catch(e => {
    ConduitGrpcSdk.Logger.error(e);
});
```
