# Headers


These are headers used for [Application Requests](./router.mdx#request-types-app).<br />

## Authorization {#headers-auth}

A bearer formatted access token used for user authentication.<br />
This header is only required by user-authenticated routes.

``` json title="Example"
{ "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjYyNDE5ODM0ZmMwZGFiMGVhZjA1ZjVjZSIsImlhdCI6MTY0ODQ2NjA3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzM0ODY2MDc5fQ.mDlETjM2y0hahbhJy_cKRmNM5X4wFigqoWw9j7QzO6E" }
```

**User access tokens cannot be used interchangeably with [administrator access tokens](../../administration/#headers-auth)!**

The [Authentication](../authentication) module provides multiple [authentication strategies](../authentication/strategies) for you to choose from.<br />
Your authentication strategy affects how you register users and obtain user authentication tokens.

<!-- TODO: Elaborate on Access/Refresh tokens, expiry, security client coupleing etc ??? -->

  <summary>Obtaining User Access and Refresh Tokens</summary>

  Out of the box, Conduit's Authentication module utilizes <a href="../authentication/strategies#local">Local Authentication</a> in order to provide you with a simple,
  yet extendable, strategy that's capable of functioning without further configuration.

## Security Client Id & Secret {#headers-security}

A client id and secret header pair related to a Conduit Security client.<br />
These headers are not required by default, unless you configure Router with client validation turned on.<br />
If you choose to do so you'll need to provide them for most administrative routes, with the exception of:

- REST API Ping Endpoints (`/` and `/health`)
- Hook Routes (`/hook/*`)
- GraphQL (`GET: /graphql`)
- Swagger (`GET: /swagger & /swagger.json` whenever Core is in development mode)

``` json title="Example"
{
  "clientid": "7cc71118441b3a9a45a6d667b198c5",
  "clientsecret": "745a3d40515abe7ca9cd5a0a4bf1e0ab1734403099cde1790cf8776cd8d50b654a5c419ad7b6fa380cc6b3f945a426465c80a2673667e669922f4fbf88489a99"
}
```
