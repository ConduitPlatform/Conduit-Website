# Chatting

Chat module can be used to add chatting functionality to your application without having to write complex lines of code.
To begin explaining how to create a chat functionality, some assumptions must be made.

## Basics

Chat communication is only possible between Conduit users. So, first, we must [create some users](../../authentication/get-started#create-a-user).
We'll need a chat room with some users to participate in now that users have been created. We can accomplish this in two ways:

- By [creating a chat room](../get-started#creating-rooms) , as a Conduit Admin through Conduit Admin Panel.
- By creating a chat room, as a Conduit User using chat user routes.

Let's follow the second way, to see how a user can create a room.

## Create a room as user

To begin, a user must be logged in before proceeding with the creation of a room. In the case of using the local authentication strategy,
you can see how to log in as a user by following the [Local Tutorial](../../authentication/tutorials/local).
At this step we'll need the user access token. Then just simply type in a terminal:

```bash = "Create a room as user"
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:3000/chat/rooms' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer "userAccessToken" ' \
--data-raw '{
  "roomName": "Conduit Users",
  "users": ["participantUserId1","participantUserId2"]
}'
```

Three individuals will be placed in a room dubbed ***Conduit Users***. It should be clear that in order to build a chat room, the logged-in userId is not necessary
to be included in the users array. The user who creates a room is also a participant.

```json title="Resposne"
{
    "roomId": "someId"
}
```
