# Chatting

To create a chat functionality in an application, it is necessary to make some assumptions about the requirements and constraints of the project.
With these assumptions in mind, we can outline the steps for using the Conduit chat module.

## Basics

To create a chat functionality within an application the first step is to [create some users](../../authentication/get-started#create-a-user).
Once this is in place, the next step is to create a chat room where users can participate in real-time communication.
We'll need a chat room with some users to participate in now that users have been created. We can accomplish this in two ways:


- By [creating a chat room](../get-started#creating-rooms) , as a Conduit Admin through Conduit Admin Panel.
- By creating a chat room, as a Conduit User using chat user routes.

Let's follow the second way, to see how a user can create a room.

## Create a room as user

To begin, a user must be logged in before proceeding with the creation of a room. In case of using the local authentication strategy,
you can see how to log in as a user by following the [Local Tutorial](../../authentication/tutorials/local).
At this step we'll need the user access token. Then just simply type in a terminal:

```bash = "Create a room as user"
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:3000/chat/rooms' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer "userAccessToken" ' \
--data-raw '{
  "roomName": "Conduit Users",
  "users": ["participantUserId1","participantUserId2"]
}'
```

Three individuals will be placed in a room dubbed ***Conduit Users***. It should be clear that in order to build a chat room,
the authenticated user id should not be included int the user's array. The user who creates a room is also a participant.

```json title="Response"
{
    "roomId": "someId"
}
```
## Send a message

## Add users in a chat room

As a user, you have the option to add new users to the chat room after it has been created.
As previously stated, you must be logged in as a user to follow this tutorial, so the user access token is required.

```bash title="Add users in a room"
curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:3000/chat/rooms/{roomId}/addUsers' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'masterkey: M4ST3RK3Y' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer "userAccessToken"' \
--data-raw '{
  "users": ["someUserId1","someUserId2"]
}'
```
If user fits in the room successfully then an appropriate message will be returned to you.

```json title="Response"
{
    "result": "Users added"
}
```

## Leaving a room

Chat module also provides the option of leaving a room. Again you'll need to be logged in as a user.

```bash title="Add users in a room"
curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:3000/chat/leave/6390b1808c52d0b5a436a429' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'masterkey: M4ST3RK3Y' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer "userAccessToken"' \
--data-raw ''
```

```json title="Response"
{
    "result": "Ok"
}
```
