# SDK Usage

## Room Creation

Let's begin by creating a room. All you need is:
- A participant array which include the participants user ids.
- A room name.

```ts title="Request"
await grpcSdk.chat.createRoom({
    name: "roomName",
    participants: ["userId1", "userId2"],
});
```
```ts title="Response"
{
    room: {
      _id: "roomId",
      name: "roomName",
      participants: ["userId1", "userId2"]
    }
}
```

## Room Deletion

```ts title="Request"
await grpcSdk.chat.deleteRoom({
    id: "roomId",
});
```
```ts title="Response"
{
    room: {
        _id: "roomId",
        name: "roomName",
        participants: ["userId1", "userId2"]
    }
}
```

## Sending Messages

Before sending a message to a group, make sure the user you're sending it as is already a member of the group.

```ts title="Request"
await grpcSdk.chat.sendMessage({
    userId: "userId",
    roomId: "roomId",
    message: "Hello Conduit users!"
});
```
