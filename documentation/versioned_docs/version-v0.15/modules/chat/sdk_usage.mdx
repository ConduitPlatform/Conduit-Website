# SDK Usage

Chat sdk comes with three functionalities. Guess what ? You can create, delete rooms and send messages.
You might wonder  "Why I can not update the room ?". And the answer is that is not implemented yet.


## Create a room

Let's begin by creating a room. All you need is:
- A participant array which include the participants user ids.
- A room name.

```ts title="Response"
await grpcSdk.chat.createRoom({
    name: "roomname",
    participants: ["userid1","userid2"],
})
```

```ts title="Response"
room: {
      Id: "roomid",
      name: "roomname",
      participants: ["userid1","userid2"]
}
```

In case of a successful chat room creation, the created room will be returned to you.

```ts title="Response"
{
      Id: "roomid",
      name: "roomname",
      participants: ["userid1","userid2"]
}
```

## Delete a room

Room id is only required for deleting it.

```jsx title="Request"
await grpcSdk.chat.deleteRoom({
    id: "roomid",
})
```
A room object will be returned to you if deletion takes place successfully.

```ts title="Response"
room: {
      Id: "roomid",
      name: "roomname",
      participants: ["userid1","userid2"]
}
```


## Send a message
Finally, sending a message to a room is also an easy operation. To send a message, you have to belong to the room and to be logged in as a user.

```ts title="Response"
await grpcSdk.chat.sendMessage({
    roomId: "roomid",
    message: "Hello Conduit users!"
})
```
