# Prometheus Metrics

Conduit provides support for collecting useful metrics from each module with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
By exposing a set of metrics with your deployment, you can easily monitor the health and status of your Conduit Backend and diagnose any issues.


## Monitoring and Diagnotics

Suppose you have a deployment with all modules, and you want to monitor the health of each module. You would have to check each one for
any potential errors or issues that may be causing problems. Wouldn't it be easier to have a collection mechanism
for each instance of the modules to collect and expose the health status so that you can then have a quick overview of the health of the entire deployment?

For this reason Conduit provides a metrics collection mechanism that allows you to probe each module in intervals and then expose the results (e.g. visualizing them with
Grafana).

## Bootstrapping Module Metrics
When you spin up a new instance of a module it will scan for the ```METRICS_PORT``` environment variable and if it is set, it will start an HTTP server on that port and expose the metrics.
```bash
METRICS_PORT=9100
```

You can then ping the module's metrics endpoint (```/metrics```) on the specified port to collect the metrics in the [Prometheus format](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/).
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:9100/metrics
```
This will give you the collected metrics for that module only. However, if you want to probe the entire deployment you will have to spin up a Prometheus server and let it scrape the metrics
from all the modules. Here is a handy Prometheus YAML configuration that lets you do this:
