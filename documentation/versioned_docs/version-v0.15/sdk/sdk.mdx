:::caution
Before proceeding, we suggest that you've already familiarized yourself with the following:<br />
[Database](../modules/database), [Router](../modules/router), [Admin](../administration),
[Database](../modules/authentication), [gRPC](https://grpc.io)
:::
:::info
The Conduit dev team remains committed to developing SDKs for multiple languages.<br />
At this time, we are only providing an official [SDK for Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@conduitplatform/conduit-grpc-sdk).
:::

# Conduit SDK ðŸ”¨

Conduit facilitates the development of modules through an SDK exposing standard module operations
and providing utils around service initialization, bus utilization, API route building, gRPC health checking etc.

As a module developer, the SDK takes care of a bunch of different things for you.<br />
Most importantly, it abstracts away the cumbersome bits of setting up connections
to distributed services and module state monitoring.

## Features âœ¨

- Ergonomic Wrappers Around Standard Module gRPC Operations
- Service Initialization & Registration (Lifecycle Hooks)
- Support for [gRPC Health Checking Protocol](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md)
- Schema Model Controller Base Class
- Route Building Utilities
- Bus Publish/Subscribe (Redis)
- State Management (Redis)
- Useful Utilities & Syntactic Sugar

## Usage

Interaction with Conduit may happen unidirectionally or bidirectionally, depending on your needs.<br />
That is to say, your application could interact with your Conduit deployment without registering itself as a module,
unless it expects to make use of features that cannot be utilized without Conduit being aware of its existence
and capable of monitoring its state.

If you're building a microservice, you're probably going to need two-way communication with Conduit.<br />
Writing a module allows you to:
- configure your module via Conduit
- register **code-level** API endpoints (gRPC, REST, GraphQL, WebSockets)
- register your own schemas

Note how you may always utilize the [Database](../modules/database) module's CMS functionality
(CRUD endpoints, [query-based endpoints](../modules/database/custom_endpoints.mdx), schema extensions)
to implement a lot of the features you'd otherwise need to support in your own code,
or even circumvent the need for a custom microservice altogether!

For the kinds of projects that do require that you build a custom module,
we've made sure to equip the SDK with the tools required to help you write clean and maintainable code.

If you're scratching your head right now, rest assured,
we'll guide you through the process and offer examples in the following pages.

## Do I Have To Use This? ðŸ¤”

Using the SDK is entirely optional.<br />
You could always just grab the [proto-files](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3)
of the services you're interested in, generate native client code for your language using `protoc`,
perform your gRPC requests manually and so on.<br />
As you'll soon come to realize, making use of the official SDK is not something you should shy away from.
