# Conduit gRPC SDK

This library provides a "framework" for Conduit service-to-service communication and module lifecycle.<br />
It is not necessary to use it when working with Conduit, you can always just take the protofile of the service
you want to communicate with and use it in your code. It sure helps to have it though.

## Build Steps

- run build.sh
- run npm build

## Features

- Defines an Interface for all modular functionalities of Conduit
- Provides constructors for model declaration in Conduit
- Provides utilities and syntactic sugar so that you can do stuff faster
