:::caution

Some of the following commands may not be supported on outdated Conduit deployments.<br />
To guarantee ideal compatibility, try and stick to the latest versions of Conduit and Conduit CLI.

[//]: # (TODO: CLI should be aware of these limitations and throw on unsupported deployments)

:::

# Conduit CLI

[//]: # (TODO: Screenshots)

Conduit's CLI is a multipurpose tool that's meant to facilitate your development experience and speed up your work
regardless of whether you're deploying a Conduit instance for your project, developing custom modules or even
contributing to the upstream project in your spare time.

If you treat it right, it's gonna deploy local instances of Conduit for you, provide API client library generation for
your frontend team, generate some TypeScript code for your custom modules and even handle your laundry... nah, wait I
thought we were not actually releasing this one until the next release, right?

Anyway, point is, you're most likely going to want to use this, so stick around if you wish to find out how to go about it.

## Requirements

While the use of Docker is not required for every single piece of functionality provided, for most typical use cases
you're going to [need Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) and configured so that your user is capable
of utilizing it without superuser privileges.<br />
For Linux users, this usually means adding your user to the `docker` group.

You're also going to need some form of support for [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).<br />
Conduit's CLI supports both v2 and v1. The former comes pre-installed with the latest versions of Docker desktop.

## Installation {#installation-methods}

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">npx install @conduitplatform/cli</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    <CliPlatformInstallation platform='Linux' />
  </TabItem>

## Bootstrapping Local Deployments {#cmd-deploy}

Deploys a local instance of Conduit using containers.<br />
By default, it's going to pick the latest stable release, select MongoDB as your database engine and
bring up any modules or features deemed essential for a barebones configuration.

If you wish to explicitly select your target Conduit version, db type or pick and configure your module selection you
should make sure to specify `--configure` while invoking this.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

``` bash title="Examples"
# Option A: Just give me a barebones setup of the latest Conduit release
npx @conduitplatform/cli deploy setup

# Option B: I wish to bring up extra modules and perform some basic configuration
npx @conduitplatform/cli deploy setup --config
```

``` bash title="Find out more"
npx @conduitplatform/cli deploy --help
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="native" label="Native Packages">

``` bash title="Examples"
# Option A: Just give me a barebones setup of the latest Conduit release
conduit deploy setup

# Option B: I wish to bring up extra modules and perform some basic configuration
conduit deploy setup --config
```

``` bash title="Find out more"
conduit deploy --help
```

## API Client Library Generation {#cmd-generateClient}

Generates an API client library for Conduit.<br />
Supports both REST and GraphQL APIs.<br />

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

``` bash title="Find out more"
npx @conduitplatform/cli generateClient --help
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="native" label="Native Packages">

``` bash title="Find out more"
conduit generateClient --help
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Schema Generation {#cmd-generateSchema}

Generates a compatible Conduit schema TypeScript file based on your deployment's schemas.<br />
This command is extremely useful if you're trying to build your own custom module.<br />
Make use of Database module's CMS functionality to create a custom schema, then use this command to generate a schema file for it.

``` bash title="Find out more"
npx @conduitplatform/cli generateSchema --help

<TabItem value="native" label="Native Packages">
