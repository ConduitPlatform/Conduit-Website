<p align="center"><em>Default credentials are: admin/admin</em></p>

The Admin Panel is the command center for everything and anything you'd want to do with Conduit.<br />
From here, you can create schemas and manage custom endpoints, manipulate data, configure authentication methods,
administer users, and honestly so much more!

Simply said, it's a dashboard that's meant to take care of all the tedious bits that come with managing a deployment
and let you spend your time on the things that actually matter.

The navigation pane on your left lists every available module your Conduit instance is aware of.<br />
Offline modules are presented at the bottom.<br />
It also provides you with a settings page for your backend's core configuration and a log out button.

Click that juicy Documentation button on the top-right of your homepage in case you ever lose your way back here.<br />
Who knows? Maybe by the time you do we'll have finally finished these docs ðŸ˜….

Each module's functionality and individual configuration is exposed in its own separate page accessible from the navigation pane.<br />
Choose a module and see what's available. I'll be picking my trusty Database module.

![Database Schema View](/v0.14/modules/database/admin/schema_list_view.png)

Configurable modules offer a Settings tab where you can view and update their configuration.<br />
You can find additional information on module-specific administration pages in their respective section of the [Modules section](../modules/).
