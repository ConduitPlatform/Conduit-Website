# Custom Endpoints

Conduit attempts to help you cut back on boilerplate code.<br />
Besides offering support for optional auto-generated CRUD endpoints for your custom schemas,
it also provides the means for you to construct powerful functional endpoints,
allowing you to effortlessly operate on your backend without having to write any code whatsoever.

These endpoints are schema-based, meaning they make use of a specific schema's entries.<br />
Both system and custom schemas are supported.

## Creating Endpoints

Bring up the Admin Panel and navigate to the `Database` section.<br />
Then head to the `Custom Endpoints` tab.

Let's show you around the place.<br />
Here's a rundown of the base fields and options making up a custom endpoint:

- `Name` to be used as the endpoint's name
- `Authenticated` defines whether endpoint requires user authentication
- `Operation` to be used for the endpoint
- `Schema` to be used for the endpoint

`Find/Get` operations additionally offer the following options:

- `Paginated` defines whether endpoint should provide pagination (skip/limit)
- `Sorted` defines whether results should be sorted

Upon selecting your request type, the page is updated with the appropriate sections
to be used while defining your endpoint's behavior.

### Inputs {#inputs}

![Add Input](/v0.14/first_app/add_input.png)

If you wish to, you may conditionally operate on your data based on variable fields.<br />
Here's what makes up an input:

- `Name` to be used while referring to this field in the followup sections
- `Type` specifies the type of the field
- `Location` defines whether the field should be a query, body or url param
- `Array` defines whether the field should be an array
- `Optional` defines whether the field should be optional

### Queries {#queries}

![Add Query](/v0.14/first_app/add_condition.png)

You're going to have to specify at least one query condition for your endpoint.<br />
Queries require a schema field to be compared against as well as a condition,
comparing that field to a specific value (or a set of values).<br />
These values may be defined through any of the following:

- `System Values` are internal context values (middleware-dependent)
- `Custom Values` may be provided during endpoint creation (hardcoded)
- `Schema Fields` are existing fields from the target schema
- `Input Fields` are defined in the [`Inputs` section](#inputs)

The [SQL-style Like operator](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp) is also supported.

Query condition checks can be `AND`ed or `OR`ed.<br />
They may also be nested however you see fit.

### Assignments {#assignments}

While creating or updating a schema doc entry, you're going to have to specify the values for your schema fields.<br />
`Create` and `Update/Edit` operations require that you specify all schema fields,
whereas `Patch` ones let you partially update an existing schema document.

Assignment definitions include the following fields:

- `Schema Field` to be populated
- `Action` to be used for the operation
- `Assignment Value` to be used while populating the field

A field may be populated through any of the following actions:

- `SET` populates the field with target assignment value
- `INCREMENT` increments the field by target assignment value
- `DECREMENT` decrements the field by target assignment value
- `APPEND` appends the target assignment value to an array field
- `REMOVE` removes the target assignment value from an array field

Similarly to how [`Queries`](#queries) operate, assignment values may come from:

- request context
- inputs (specified in the [Inputs section](#inputs))
- custom values
