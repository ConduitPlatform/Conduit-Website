# Google

In this tutorial, we'll be setting up Google authentication for Conduit.<br />
Before we begin, we'll need to create a Google Application.

## Configure Google

To begin the Google Authentication you need to get some credentials.<br />
Go to your [Google Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library) and create a new project.<br />
Once you have a new project, you have to request your app credentials.

Click the `CREATE CREDENTIALS` button at the top of the page.

Choose **OAuth Client ID**.<br />
You will also be asked for an application type. Choose `Web App`.<br />
Your application credentials have been generated.<br />
You will only need the client id and client secret.<br />

You need to add an **Authorized redirect URI**.<br />
Hit **http://localhost:<CONDUIT_PORT>/hook/authentication/google.**<br />

A pop-up window will be displayed to you which contain your client id and client secret.<br />

## Authenticate with Google

At this step you need to begin authorize with Google by calling the `/authentication/init/google` route.<br />
Open postman and make a GET request to this route.By doing this you will get a link.<br />

![Google Postman](/v0.14/modules/authentication/tutorials/google_postman.png)

Open a browser and navigate to this link.<br />
If your browser has been redirected to the url which you configured everything went well and the authentication has been completed.
