# WebSockets API

Conduit provides support for WebSocket connections through [Socket.io](https://socket.io/).<br />
This allows for fast and reliable bidirectional data flows through a persistent connection.

### Performing Requests

Making WebSocket requests requires that you specify a socket server connection path as well as a handshake path.

Conduit modules make use of `/moduleName/` as their server connection path.<br />
The handshake path is `/realtime`.

Make sure you also pass along your [application headers](./headers#headers-app).

<!-- TODO: WIP Section
Let's follow up with a couple examples on how to set up persistent socket connections to Conduit's Chat module.

<details>
<summary>Bringing up the Chat module</summary>

``` bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConduitPlatform/Conduit/latest/docker/Makefile > Makefile
make create-network
make start-core
make start-database
make start-chat
```

Uh, oh, looks like this section is currently Under Development.<br />
We'll do our best to document this as soon as possible.<br />
If you need help making use of our sockets now, shoot us a question on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/fBqUQ23M7g).
