# GraphQL API

Conduit exposes a GraphQL server for you to perform GraphQL requests.<br />
Your application-level GraphQL path is `/graphql`.<br />
You may always retrieve the exact url through the Admin Panel.

</div>

Navigating to the above URL through your web browser should bring up GraphQL Playground.<br />
You can use that to test out your requests.

## Performing Requests

Performing certain GraphQL queries requires that you pass in certain [application request headers](./headers#headers-app).<br />
What this typically means is passing along an `Authorization` header for your user authenticated requests.<br />
If you've enabled [clientValidation](./headers#headers-security) for your application requests,
you'll additionally provide a security client id and secret pair.

``` json title="User Authenticated Request Headers Example"
{
	"Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjYyMzQ3MjMzYTQ5ODg4MGNkOWI4MDY5ZSIsImlhdCI6MTY0NzYwNDk5OCwiZXhwIjoxNzM0MDA0OTk4fQ.D_TsIaQlMimft4CXhCo_aOs0vk6opnClxM3aFtFF4Qc"
}
```

Upon specifying your headers in the GraphQL Playground page, your route documentation should become available to you.<br />
Lets perform our first query, shall we?

Let's make a query to find out which chat rooms are currently registered in our database!<br />
This should return an array containing the ids of the registered chat rooms.<br />
Make sure the [Chat module](../chat) is currently online.

``` bash title="Example Request"
query getRooms($skip: Number,$limit:Number) {
	getChatRooms(skip: $skip, limit:$limit) {
		rooms {
			_id
		}
	}
}
```

``` json title="Example Query Variables"
{
  "skip": 0,
  "limit": 0
}
```
