# Metrics

Conduit exposes a set of useful metrics for your modules using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/),
allowing you to monitor the health and status of your backend
and diagnose any potential issues in your deployment.

# Inspection

Conduit's [Admin Panel](./administration/administration.mdx) displays metric information through numerous
indicator elements and configurable graphs in its interface so that you may conveniently  inspect your deployment.

Most critical information is already exposed there, but if wish to personalize your own dashboard or fine-tune the way
you observe your metrics, you may always manually set up
[Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/prometheus/),
or any other metrics inspection tool that supports Prometheus,
and configure it however you see fit for your own needs.

## Configuration

### CLI Deployments

If you're setting up a local deployment using [Conduit's CLI](./cli.mdx) you should already have metrics-support
enabled out of the box for all of your modules.

Prometheus runs on [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).<br />
Individual module metrics server endpoints are not directly exposed outside the container network
so as to avoid any potential port collisions, therefore you can't manually scrape them using a custom Prometheus setup,
but you may still run PromQL queries for all of them through the pre-deployed Prometheus instance.

### Manual Deployments

If you're manually configuring your own dev/production cluster, you should provide
and [configure](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/)
a Prometheus instance to be used by your deployment.

Conduit Core and modules expect you to specify a port for their metrics http server
through the `METRICS_PORT` environment variable.<br />
You may ping their `/metrics` endpoint on the specified port to collect individual container metrics.<br />
Exposed metrics data is [formatted for Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/).<br />
Your Prometheus instance should be configured appropriately so as to scrape these endpoints.

In order for the [Admin Panel](./administration/administration.mdx) to display metrics-related information
you should also provide Conduit-UI with your Prometheus instance's url through the `PROMETHEUS_URL` env var.
